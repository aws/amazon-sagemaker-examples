    "R is a popular open source statistical programming language, with a lengthy history in Data Science and Machine Learning.  The breadth of algorithms available as R packages is impressive and fuels a diverse community of users.  In this example, we'll combine one of those algorithms ([Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_adaptive_regression_splines)) with SageMaker's hyperparameter tuning capabilities to build a simple model on the well-known [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will focus mainly on the integration of hyperparameter tuning and a custom algorithm container, as well as hosting the tuned model and making inference using the endpoint. For more examples, please see this [notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/r_bring_your_own/r_bring_your_own.ipynb).\n",

Note, if a role not associated with the current notebook instance, or more than one role is required for training and/or hosting, please replace `sagemaker.get_execution_role()` with a the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

    "- **Dockerfile**:  This specifies the configuration for our docker container.  Smaller containers are preferred for Amazon SageMaker as they lead to faster spin up times in training and endpoint creation, so this container is kept minimal.  It simply starts with Ubuntu, installs R, mda, and plumber libraries, then adds `mars.R` and `plumber.R`, and finally sets `mars.R` to run as the entrypoint when launched."

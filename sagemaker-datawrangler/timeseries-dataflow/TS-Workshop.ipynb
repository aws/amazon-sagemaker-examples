    "In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations in the same dataset. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error. The latter are sometimes excluded from the dataset. For example, in our dataset we have `tip_amount` feature and usually it is less than 10 dollars, but due to an error in a data collection, some values can show thousands of dollar as a tip. Such data errors will skew statistics and aggregated values which will lead to a lower model accuracy. \n",

This transform detects and fixes outliers in numeric features using the mean and standard deviation. You specify the number of standard deviations a value must vary from the mean to be considered an outlier.

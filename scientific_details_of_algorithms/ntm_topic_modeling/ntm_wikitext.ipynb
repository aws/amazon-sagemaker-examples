    "Amazon SageMaker Neural Topic Model(NTM) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the topic distributions of large collections of document corpus. With SageMaker NTM, you can build machine learning solutions for use cases such as document classification, information retrieval, and content recommendation. SageMaker provides a rich set of model training configuration options such as network architecture, automatic early stopping, as well as hyperparameters to fine-tune between a magnitude of metrics such as document modeling accuracy, human interpretability, and granularity of the learned topics.  see Introduction to the Amazon SageMaker Neural Topic Model (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introduction-to-the-amazon-sagemaker-neural-topic-model/) if you are not already familiar with SageMaker and SageMaker NTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to machine learning, or want to free up time to focus on other tasks, then the fully automated Amazon Comprehend topic modeling API is the best option. If you are a data science specialist looking for finer control over the various layers of building and tuning your own topic modeling model, then the Amazon SageMaker NTM might work better for you. For example, letâ€™s say you are building a document topic tagging application that needs a customized vocabulary, and you need the ability to adjust the algorithm hyperparameters, such as the number of layers of the neural network, so you can train a topic model that meets the target accuracy in terms of coherence and uniqueness scores. In this case, the Amazon SageMaker NTM would be the appropriate tool to use.\n",

    "- Auxiliary vocabulary channel\n",
    "- Word Embedding Topic Coherence (WETC) and Topic Uniqueness (TU) metrics\n",
    "- Subsampling data during training\n",

    "In addition to these new features, by optimizing sparse operations and the parameter server, we have improved the speed of the algorithm by 2x for training and 4x for evaluation on a single GPU. The speedup is even more significant for multi-gpu training."

    "## Auxiliary vocabulary channel\n",
    "When an NTM training job runs, it outputs the training status and evaluation metrics to the CloudWatch logs. Among the outputs are lists of top words detected for each of the learned topics. Prior to the availability of auxiliary vocabulary channel support, the top words were represented as integers, and customers needed to map the integers to an external custom vocabulary lookup table in order to know what the actual words were. With the support of auxiliary vocabulary channel, users can now add a vocabulary file as an additional data input channel, and SageMaker NTM will output the actual words in a topic instead of integers. This feature eliminates the manual effort needed to map integers to the actual vocabulary. Below is a sample of what a custom vocabulary text file look like. The text file will simply contain a list of words, one word per row, in the order corresponding to the integer IDs provided in the data.\n",

    "## Word Embedding Topic Coherence metrics\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of an trained SageMaker NTM model, customers can examine the perplexity metric emitted by the training job.  Sometimes, however customers also want to evaluate the topic coherence of a model that measures the closeness of the words in a topic. A good topic should have semantically similar words in it. Traditional methods like the Normalized Point-wise Mutual Information(NPMI), while widely accepted, require a large external corpus.  The new WETC metric measures the similarity of words in a topic by using a pre-trained word embedding, [Glove-6B-400K-50d](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, each word in the vocabulary is given a vector representation (embedding). We compute the WETC of a topic by averaging the pair-wise cosine similarities between the vectors corresponding to the top words of the topic. Finally, we average the WETC for all the topics to obtain a single score for the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our tests have shown that WETC correlates very well with NPMI as an effective surrogate. For details about the pair-wise WETC computation and its correlation to NPMI, please refer to our paper [Coherence-Aware Neural Topic Modeling, Ding et. al. 2018 (Accepted for EMNLP 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02687.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "WETC ranges between 0 and 1, higher is better. Typical value would be in the range of 0.2 to 0.8. The WETC metric is evaluated whenever the vocabulary file is provided. The average WETC score over the topics is displayed in the log above the top words of all topics. The WETC metric for each topic is also displayed along with the top words of each topic. Please refer to the screenshot below for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note in case many of the words in the supplied vocabulary cannot be found in the pre-trained word embedding, the WETC score can be misleading. Therefore we provide a warning message to alert the user exactly how many words in the vocabulary do not have an embedding:\n",

    "In typical online training, the entire training dataset is fed into the training algorithm for each epoch.  When the corpus is large, this leads to long training time.  With effective subsampling of the training dataset, we can achieve faster model convergence while maintaining the model performance.  The new subsampling feature of the SageMaker NMT allows customers to specify a percentage of training data used for training using a new hyperparameter, `sub_sample`.  For example, specifying 0.8 for `sub_sample` would direct SageMaker NTM to use 80% of training data randomly for each epoch. As a result, the algorithm will stochastically cover different subsets of data during different epochs. You can configure this value in both the SageMaker console or directly training code. See sample code below on how to set this value for training.\n",

In both settings, we set `epochs = 100` and NTM would early-exit training when the loss on validation data does not improve in 3 consecutive epochs. We report the TU, WETC, NPMI of the best epoch based on validation loss as well as the total time for both settings below. Note we ran each training job on a single GPU of a `p2.8xlarge` machine.\n",

The increase in the number of epochs to convergence is expected due to the variance introduced by training on a random subset of data per epoch. Yet the overall training time is reduced because training is about 5 times faster per epoch at the subsampling rate of 0.2. We also note the higher scores in terms of TU, WETC and NPMI at the end of training with subsampling. \n"

    "In this blog post, we introduced 3 new features of SageMaker NTM algorithm. Upon reading this blog and completing the new sample notebook, you should have learned how to add an auxiliary vocabulary channel to automatically map integer representations of words in the detected topics to a human understandable vocabulary. You also have learned to evaluate the quality of the a model using both Word Embedding Topic Coherence and Topic Uniqueness metrics. Lastly, you learned to use the subsampling feature to reduce the model training time while maintaining similar model performance."

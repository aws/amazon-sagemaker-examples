    "Selecting the right hyperparameter values for your machine learning model can be difficult. The right answer is dependent on your data; some algorithms have many different hyperparameters that can be tweaked; some are very sensitive to the hyperparameter values selected; and most have a non-linear relationship between model fit and hyperparameter values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning helps with automating the hyperparameter tuning process. In many occasions the tuning process is iterative and requires to run multiple tuning jobs after analyzing the results to get the best objective metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to iteratively tune an image classifer leveraging the warm start feature of Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning. The [caltech-256 dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/) will be used to train the image classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Warm start configuration allows you to create a new tuning job with the learning gathered in a parent tuning job by specifying up to 5 parent tuning jobs. If a warm start configuration is specified, Automatic Model Tuning will load the previous [hyperparameter set, objective metrics values] to warm start the new tuning job. This means, you can continue optimizing your model from the point you finished your previous tuning job experiment. \n",

    "Download the data and transfer to S3 for use in training. In this example, we are using [Caltech-256](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/) dataset, which contains 30608 images of 256 objects. For the training and validation data, we follow the splitting scheme in this MXNet [example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/data/caltech256.sh). In particular, it randomly selects 60 images per class for training, and uses the remaining data for validation. The algorithm takes `RecordIO` files as input. The user can also provide the image files as input, which will be converted into `RecordIO` format using MXNet's [im2rec](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/how_to/recordio.html?highlight=im2rec) tool. It takes around 50 seconds to converted the entire Caltech-256 dataset (~1.2GB) on a p2.xlarge instance. However, for this example, we will directly use recordio format. "

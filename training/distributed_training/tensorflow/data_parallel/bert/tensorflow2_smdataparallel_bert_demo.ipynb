    "# Distributed data parallel BERT training with TensorFlow 2 and SageMaker distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon SageMaker's distributed library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/distributed-training.html) can be used to train deep learning models faster and cheaper. The [data parallel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-parallel.html) feature in this library (`smdistributed.dataparallel`) is a distributed data parallel training framework for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook example shows how to use `smdistributed.dataparallel` with TensorFlow(version 2.4.1) on [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to train a BERT model using [Amazon FSx for Lustre file-system](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/) as data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of steps is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stage dataset in [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Original dataset for BERT pretraining consists of text passages from BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al. 2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words). Please follow original guidelines by NVidia to prepare training data in hdf5 format - \n",
    "https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/blob/master/PyTorch/LanguageModeling/BERT/README.md#getting-the-data\n",
    "2. Create Amazon FSx Lustre file-system and import data into the file-system from S3\n",
    "3. Build Docker training image and push it to [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)\n",
    "4. Configure data input channels for SageMaker\n",
    "5. Configure hyper-prarameters\n",
    "6. Define training metrics\n",
    "7. Define training job, set distribution strategy for `smdistributed.dataparallel` and start training\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**  With large traning dataset, we recommend using [Amazon FSx](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/) as the input filesystem for the SageMaker training job. FSx file input to SageMaker significantly cuts down training start up time on SageMaker because it avoids downloading the training data each time you start the training job (as done with S3 input for SageMaker training job) and provides good data read throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This example requires SageMaker Python SDK v2.X."

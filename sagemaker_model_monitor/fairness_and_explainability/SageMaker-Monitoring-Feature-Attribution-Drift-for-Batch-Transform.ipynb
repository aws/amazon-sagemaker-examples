    "[Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor.html) continuously monitors the quality of Amazon SageMaker machine learning models in production. It enables developers to set alerts for when there are deviations in the model quality. Early and pro-active detection of these deviations enables corrective actions, such as retraining models, auditing upstream systems, or fixing data quality issues without having to monitor models manually or build additional tooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon SageMaker Clarify Model Explainability Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-model-monitor-feature-attribution-drift.html) is a model monitor that helps data scientists and ML engineers monitor predictions for feature attribution drift on a regular basis. A drift in the distribution of live data for models in production can result in a corresponding drift in the feature attribution values. As the model is monitored, customers can view exportable reports and graphs detailing feature attributions in SageMaker Studio and configure alerts in Amazon CloudWatch to receive notifications if it is detected that the attribution values drift beyond a certain threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the process for setting up a [SageMaker Clarify Feature Attribution Drift Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-model-monitor-feature-attribution-drift.html) for continuous monitoring of feature attribution drift of the data and model used by a regularly running [SageMaker Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html) job. The model input and output are in CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you can use the model explainability monitor for batch transform in this way,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Schedule a model explainability monitor to monitor a data capture S3 location\n",
    "1. Regularly run transform jobs with data capture enabled, the jobs save captured data to the data capture S3 URI\n",
    "\n",
    "The monitor executes processing jobs regularly to do feature attribution analysis, and then generate analysis reports and publish metrics to CloudWatch."

    "The **SageMaker Python SDK** helps you deploy your models for training and hosting in optimized, productions ready containers in SageMaker. The SageMaker Python SDK is easy to use, modular, extensible and compatible with TensorFlow, MXNet, PyTorch and Chainer. This tutorial focuses on how to create a convolutional neural network model to train the [Cifar10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) using **PyTorch in local mode**.\n",

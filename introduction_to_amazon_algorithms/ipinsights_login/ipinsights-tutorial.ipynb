    "## Introduction\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon SageMaker IP Insights algorithm uses statistical modeling and neural networks to capture associations between online resources (such as account IDs or hostnames) and IPv4 addresses. Under the hood, it learns vector representations for online resources and IP addresses. This essentially means that if the vector representing an IP address and an online resource are close together, then it is likey for that IP address to access that online resource, even if it has never accessed it before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use the Amazon SageMaker IP Insights algorithm to train a model on synthetic data. We then use this model to perform inference on the data and show how to discover anomalies. After running this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- obtain, transform, and store data for use in Amazon SageMaker,\n",
    "- create an AWS SageMaker training job to produce an IP Insights model,\n",
    "- use the model to perform inference with an Amazon SageMaker endpoint.\n",

    "In this notebook, we have showed how to configure the basic training, deployment, and usage of the Amazon SageMaker IP Insights algorithm. All SageMaker algorithms come with support for two additional services that make optimizing and using the algorithm that much easier: Automatic Model Tuning and Batch Transform service. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning\n",
    "The results above were based on using the default hyperparameters of the SageMaker IP Insights algorithm. If we wanted to improve the model's performance even more, we can use [Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html) to automate the process of finding the hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation Dataset\n",
    "Previously, we separated our dataset into a training and test set to validate the performance of a single IP Insights model. However, when we do model tuning, we train many IP Insights models in parallel. If we were to use the same test dataset to select the best model, we bias our model selection such that we don't know if we selected the best model in general, or just the best model for that particular dateaset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need to separate our test set into a validation dataset and a test dataset. The validation dataset is used for model selection. Then once we pick the model with the best performance, we evaluate it the winner on a test set just as before. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation Metrics\n",
    "For SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning to work, we need an objective metric which determines the performance of the model we want to optimize. Because SageMaker IP Insights is an usupervised algorithm, we do not have a clearly defined metric for performance (such as percentage of fraudulent events discovered). \n",
    "\n",
    "We allow the user to provide a validation set of sample data (same format as training data bove) through the `validation` channel. We then fix the negative sampling strategy to use `random_negative_sampling_rate=1` and `shuffled_negative_sampling_rate=0` and generate a validation dataset by assigning corresponding labels to the real and simulated data. We then calculate the model's `descriminator_auc` metric. We do this by taking the model's predicted labels and the 'true' simulated labels and compute the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) on the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We set up the `HyperParameterTuner` to maximize the `discriminator_auc` on the validation dataset. We also need to set the search space for the hyperparameters. We give recommended ranges for the hyperparmaeters in the [Amazon SageMaker IP Insights (Hyperparameters)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ip-insights-hyperparameters.html) documentation. \n"

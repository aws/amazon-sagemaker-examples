    "# Reduce Training Time with Apache MXNet and Horovod on Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high quality models. As datasets continue to increase in size, additional compute is required to reduce the amount of time it takes to train. One method to scale horizontally and add these additional resources on SageMaker is through the use of Horovod and Apache MXNet. In this post, we will show how users can reduce training time with MXNet and Horovod on SageMaker. Finally, we will demonstrate how you can improve performance even more with advanced sections on Horovod Timeline, Horovod Autotune, Horovod Fusion, and MXNet Optimization.  \n",

    "# Distributed Training \n",
    "Distributed training of neural networks for computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) applications has become ubiquitous. With Apache MXNet, you only need to modify a few lines of code to enable distributed training. \n",
    "Distributed training allows you to reduce training time by scaling horizontally. The goal is to split training tasks into independent subtasks and execute these across multiple devices. There are primarily two approaches for training in parallel:\n",
    "   * Data parallelism: You distribute the data and share the model across multiple compute resources.\n",
    "   * Model parallelism: You distribute the model and share transformed data across multiple compute resources. \n",
    "     \n",
    "In this blog, we focus on data parallelism. Specifically, we discuss how Horovod and MXNet allow you to train efficiently on SageMaker.\n",
    " \n",
    "# Horovod Overview\n",
    "Horovod is an open-source distributed deep learning framework. It leverages efficient inter-GPU and inter-node communication methods such as NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) and Message Passing Interface (MPI) to distribute and aggregate model parameters between workers. Horovod makes distributed deep learning fast and easy by utilizing a single-GPU training script and scaling it across many GPUs in parallel. It is built on top of the ring-allreduce communication protocol. This approach allows each training process (i.e. process running on a single GPU device) to talk to its peers and exchange gradients by averaging (\"reduction\") on a subset of gradients. The diagram below illustrates how ring-allreduce works.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='images/peer_to_peer.png'  style=\"width: 900px;\"><br>\n",
    "    Fig. 1 The ring-allreduce algorithm allows worker nodes to average gradients and disperse them to all nodes without the need for a parameter server (<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05799.pdf>source</a>)\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "</center> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache MXNet is integrated with Horovod through the distributed training APIs defined in Horovod and you can convert the non-distributed training by following the higher level code skeleton, which will also be shown below.  Although this greatly simplifies the process of using Horovod, other complexities need to be considered. For example, you may need to install additional software and libraries to resolve your incompatibilities for making distributed training work. Horovod requires a certain version of Open MPI, and if you want to leverage high-performance training on NVIDIA GPUs you need to install NCCL libraries. These complexities are amplified when you scale across multiple devices, since you need to make sure all the software and libraries in the new nodes are properly installed and configured.\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker includes all the required libraries to run distributed training with MXNet and Horovod. Prebuilt Sagemaker Docker Images come with popular open-source deep learning frameworks and pre-configured CUDA, cuDNN, MPI, and NCCL libraries. SageMaker manages the difficult process of properly installing and configuring your cluster. Together SageMaker and MXNet simplify training with Horovod by managing the complexities to support distributed training at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test Problem and Dataset\n",
    "In order to benchmark the efficiencies realized by Horovod we trained the notoriously resource-intensive model architecture Faster-RCNN. This model architecture was first introduced in 2016, and is currently considered the baseline model architecture for the popular Computer Vision task of Object Detection (Faster-RCNN). Apache MXNet provides pre-built Faster-RCNN models as part of the GluonCV Model Zoo, simplifying the process of training these models.\n",
    "To train our object detection and instance segmentation models, we used the popular COCO2017 dataset. This dataset provides more than 200,000 images and their corresponding labels. COCO2017 dataset is considered an industry standard for benchmarking CV models.\n",
    "GluonCV is a computer-vision toolkit built on top of MXNet. It provides out-of-the-box support for various CV tasks including data loading and preprocessing for many common algorithm’s available within its model zoo. It also has a tutorial on how to get the COCO2017 dataset.\n",
    "In order to make this process replicable for Amazon SageMaker users, we will show an entire end-to-end process for training Faster-RCNN with Horovod and MXNet. To begin, we first open the Jupyter environment on your Sagemaker Notebook and use the conda_mxnet_p36 kernel. Next, we install the required Python packages:\n"

    "In this example, we will show you how to train an object detector by re-using a model you previously trained in the SageMaker. With this model re-using ability, you can save the training time when you update the model with new data or improving the model quality with the same data. In the first half of this notebook ([Intial Training](#Initial-Training)), we will follow the [training with RecordIO format example](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/object_detection_pascalvoc_coco/object_detection_recordio_format.ipynb) to train a object detection model on the [Pascal VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/).

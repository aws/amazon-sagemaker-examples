    "**Natural language processing (NLP)** is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of \"understanding\" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.

    "### SEC Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point for a vast amount of financial NLP is text in SEC filings. The SEC requires companies to report different types of information related to various events involving companies. The full list of SEC forms is here: https://www.sec.gov/forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "SEC filings are widely used by financial services companies as a source of information about companies in order to make trading, lending, investment, and risk management decisions. Because these filings are required by regulation, they are of high quality and veracity. They contain forward-looking information that helps with forecasts and are written with a view to the future, required by regulation. In addition, in recent times, the value of historical time-series data has degraded, since economies have been structurally transformed by trade wars, pandemics, and political upheavals. Therefore, text as a source of forward-looking information has been increasing in relevance. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Obtain the dataset using the SageMaker JumpStart Industry Python SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Downloading SEC filings is done from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) website, which provides open data access. EDGAR is the primary system under the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) for companies and others submitting documents under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and the Investment Company Act of 1940. EDGAR contains millions of company and individual filings. The system processes about 3,000 filings per day, serves up 3,000 terabytes of data to the public annually, and accommodates 40,000 new filers per year on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to download the data, and some open source packages available to extract the text from these filings. However, these require extensive programming and are not always easy-to-use. We provide a simple one-API call that will create a dataset in a few lines of code, for any period of time and for numerous tickers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have wrapped the extraction functionality into a SageMaker processing container and provide this notebook to enable users to download a dataset of filings with metadata such as dates and parsed plain text that can then be used for machine learning using other SageMaker tools. This is included in the [SageMaker Industry Jumpstart Industry](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-pre-trained-financial-language-models-for-transfer-learning-in-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/) library for financial language models. Users only need to specify a date range and a list of ticker symbols, and the library will take care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now, the solution supports extracting a popular subset of SEC forms in plain text (excluding tables): 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, 497, 497K, S-3ASR, and N-1A. For each of these, we provide examples throughout this notebook and a brief description of each form. For the 10-K and 10-Q forms, filed every year or quarter, we also extract the Management Discussion and Analysis (MDNA) section, which is the primary forward-looking section in the filing. This is the section that has been most widely used in financial text analysis. Therefore, we provide this section automatically in a separate column of the dataframe alongside the full text of the filing.\n",

This library provides us an easy to use functionality to obtain either one or multiple SEC reports for one or more Ticker symbols or CIKs. The ticker or CIK number will be passed to the SageMaker Pipeline using Pipeline parameter `inference_ticker_cik`. For demo purposes of this Pipeline we will focus on a single Ticker/CIK number at a time and the MDNA section of the 10-K form. The first processing will extract the MDNA from the 10-K form for a company and will also gather few news articles related to the company from the NewsCatcher API.

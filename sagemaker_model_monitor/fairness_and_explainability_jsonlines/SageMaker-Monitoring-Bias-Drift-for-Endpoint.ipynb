    "[Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor.html) continuously monitors the quality of Amazon SageMaker machine learning models in production. It enables developers to set alerts for when there are deviations in the model quality. Early and pro-active detection of these deviations enables corrective actions, such as retraining models, auditing upstream systems, or fixing data quality issues without having to monitor models manually or build additional tooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon SageMaker Clarify Model Bias Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-model-monitor-bias-drift.html) is a model monitor that helps data scientists and ML engineers monitor predictions for bias on a regular basis. Bias can be introduced or exacerbated in deployed ML models when the training data differs from the data that the model sees during deployment (that is, the live data). These kinds of changes in the live data distribution might be temporary (for example, due to some short-lived, real-world events) or permanent. In either case, it might be important to detect these changes. For example, the outputs of a model for predicting home prices can become biased if the mortgage rates used to train the model differ from current, real-world mortgage rates. With bias drift detection capabilities in model monitor, when SageMaker detects bias beyond a certain threshold, it automatically generates metrics that you can view in SageMaker Studio and through Amazon CloudWatch alerts. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the process for setting up a model monitor for continuous monitoring of bias drift of the data and model of a [SageMaker real-time inference endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints.html). The model input and output are in [SageMaker JSON Lines dense format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-inference.html#common-in-formats). SageMaker Clarify model monitor also supports analyzing CSV data, which is illustrated in [another notebook](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/sagemaker_model_monitor/fairness_and_explainability/SageMaker-Model-Monitor-Fairness-and-Explainability.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you can use the model bias monitor for real-time inference endpoint in this way,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enable the endpoint for data capture. Then, when the customer invokes the endpoint, the endpoint saves the invocations to a data capture S3 location. \n",
    "1. Schedule a model bias monitor to monitor the endpoint (to be more specific, the data capture S3 location) and a ground truth S3 location.\n",
    "1. You need to regularly fetch the captured data, label it, and then upload the ground truth labels to the ground truth S3 URI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The monitor executes processing jobs regularly to merge the captured data and ground truth data, do bias analysis for the merged data, and then generate analysis reports and publish metrics to CloudWatch."

    "# Detect Stalled Training and Invoke Actions Using SageMaker Debugger Rule\n",
    " \n",
    "This notebook shows you how to use the `StalledTrainingRule` built-in rule. This rule can take an action to stop your training job or send you an email/SMS, when the rule detects an inactivity in your training job for a certain time period. This functionality helps you monitor the training job status and reduces redundant resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the StalledTrainingRule Built-in Rule Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Sagemaker Debugger captures tensors that you want to watch from training jobs on [AWS Deep Learning Containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/train-debugger.html#debugger-supported-aws-containers) or your local machine. If you use one of the Debugger-integrated Deep Learning Containers, you don't need to make any changes to your training script to use the functionality of built-in rules. For information about Debugger-supported SageMaker frameworks and versions, see [Debugger-supported framework versions for zero script change](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/sagemaker.md#zero-script-change). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run a training script that uses partially supported framework by Debugger or your own custom container, you need to manually register the Debugger hook to your training script. The `smdebug` library provides tools to help the hook registration, and the sample script provided in the `src` folder includes the hook registration code as comment lines. For more information about how to manually register the Debugger hooks for this case, see the training script at `./src/simple_stalled_training.py`, and documentation at [smdebug TensorFlow hook](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/tensorflow.md), [smdebug PyTorch hook](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/pytorch.md), [smdebug MXNet hook](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/mxnet.md), and [smdebug XGBoost hook](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/xgboost.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Debugger `StalledTrainingRule` watches tensor updates from your training job. If the rule doesn't find new tensors updated to the default S3 URI for a threshold period of time, it takes an action to trigger the `StopTrainingJob` API operation. The following code cells set up a SageMaker TensorFlow estimator with the Debugger `StalledTrainingRule` to watch the `losses` pre-built tensor collection."

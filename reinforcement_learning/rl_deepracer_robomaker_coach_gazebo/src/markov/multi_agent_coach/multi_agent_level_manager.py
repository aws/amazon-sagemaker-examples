        1. Expose services of a LevelManager such as training the level, or stepping it (while behaving according to a
           LevelBehaviorScheme, e.g. as SelfPlay between two identical agents). These methods are implemented in the
           LevelManagerLogic class.
        2. Disguise as appearing as an environment to the upper level control so it will believe it is interacting with
           an environment. This includes stepping through what appears to be a regular environment, setting its phase
           or resetting it. These methods are implemented directly in LevelManager as it inherits from

    "## Data Set\n",
    "The dataset you use is the [UCI Machine Learning Abalone Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml) [1]. The aim for this task is to determine the age of an abalone snail from its physical measurements. At the core, this is a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains several features: length (the longest shell measurement), diameter (the diameter perpendicular to length), height (the height with meat in the shell), whole_weight (the weight of whole abalone), shucked_weight (the weight of meat), viscera_weight (the gut weight after bleeding), shell_weight (the weight after being dried), sex ('M', 'F', 'I' where 'I' is Infant), and rings (integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of rings turns out to be a good approximation for age (age is rings + 1.5). However, to obtain this number requires cutting the shell through the cone, staining the section, and counting the number of rings through a microscope, which is a time-consuming task. However, the other physical measurements are easier to determine. You use the dataset to build a predictive model of the variable rings through these other physical measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you upload the data to an S3 bucket, install the SageMaker Python SDK and gather some constants you can use later in this notebook.\n",

This notebook describes using machine learning (ML) for the automated identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction. It uses various features of SageMaker for managing experiments, training the model and monitoring the model after it has been deployed. \n",

We already have the dataset downloaded and processed in the `data` folder that came with this notebook. It's been split into a training set and a validation set. To see how the dataset was preprocessed take a look at this [XGBoost customer churn notebook that starts with the original dataset](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_applying_machine_learning/xgboost_customer_churn/xgboost_customer_churn.ipynb).  \n",

    "- `max_depth` controls how deep each tree within the algorithm can be built.  Deeper trees can lead to better fit, but are more computationally expensive and can lead to overfitting.  There is typically some trade-off in model performance that needs to be explored between a large number of shallow trees and a smaller number of deeper trees.\n",
    "- `subsample` controls sampling of the training data.  This technique can help reduce overfitting, but setting it too low can also starve the model of data.\n",
    "- `num_round` controls the number of boosting rounds.  This is essentially the subsequent models that are trained using the residuals of previous iterations.  Again, more rounds should produce a better fit on the training data, but can be computationally expensive or lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- `eta` controls how aggressive each round of boosting is.  Larger values lead to more conservative boosting.\n",
    "- `gamma` controls how aggressively trees are grown.  Larger values lead to more conservative models.\n",
    "- `min_child_weight` also controls how aggresively trees are grown. Large values lead to more conservative algorithm.\n",

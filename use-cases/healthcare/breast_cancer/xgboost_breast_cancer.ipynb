    "This notebook illustrates the use of SageMaker's built-in XGBoost algorithm for binary classification.\n",
    "XGBoost uses decision trees to build a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also demonstrated is Hyperparameter optimization as well as using the best model from HPO to instantiate a new endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why XGBoost and not Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst logistic regression is often used for classification exercises, it has some drawbacks. For example, additional feature engineering is required to deal with non-linear features.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost (an implementation of Gradient Boosted Trees) offers several benefits including naturally accounting for non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, as well as accommodating complex interactions between features.\n",
    "Decision Tree algorithms such as XGBoost also have the added benefit of being able to deal with missing values in both the training dataset and unseen samples that are being used for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker provides an XGBoost container that we can use to train in a managed, distributed setting, and then host as a real-time prediction endpoint\n",

    "Amazon SageMaker Studio is the first fully integrated development environment (IDE) for ML. It provides a single, web-based visual interface where you can perform all ML development steps required to build, train, tune, debug, deploy, and monitor models. It gives data scientists all the tools you need to take ML models from experimentation to production without leaving the IDE.\n",

    "Studio notebooks are one-click Jupyter notebooks that can be spun up quickly. The underlying compute resources are fully elastic, so you can easily dial up or down the available resources, and the changes take place automatically in the background without interrupting your work. You can also share notebooks with others in a few clicks. They get the exact same notebook, saved in the same place.\n",

There is typically some trade-off in model performance that needs to be explored between numerous shallow trees and a smaller number of deeper trees.\n",

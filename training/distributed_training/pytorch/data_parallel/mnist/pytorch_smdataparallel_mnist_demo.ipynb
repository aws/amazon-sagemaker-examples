    "# Part 1: Distributed data parallel MNIST training with PyTorch and SageMaker distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "[Amazon SageMaker's distributed library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/distributed-training.html) can be used to train deep learning models faster and cheaper. The [data parallel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-parallel.html) feature in this library is a distributed data parallel training framework for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet. This notebook demonstrates how to use the SageMaker distributed data library to train a PyTorch model using the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook example shows how to use `smdistributed.dataparallel` with PyTorch in SageMaker using MNIST dataset.\n",

The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits)."

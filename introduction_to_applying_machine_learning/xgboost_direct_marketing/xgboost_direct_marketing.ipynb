    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customer's based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",

In some cases, simply taking the natural log of the features is sufficient to produce more normally distributed data.  In others, bucketing values into discrete ranges is helpful.

Supervised learning models are designed to minimize error between their predictions of the target value and actuals, in the data they are given.  This last part is key, as frequently in their quest for greater accuracy, machine learning models bias themselves toward picking up on minor idiosyncrasies within the data they are shown.

The model will be trained on 70% of data, it will then be evaluated on 20% of data to give us an estimate of the accuracy we hope to have on \"new\" data, and 10% will be held back as a final testing dataset which will be used later on."

# Amazon SageMaker Examples

## AWS Marketplace

This repository contains example notebooks that show how to use [algorithms and model packages from AWS Marketplace for machine learning](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?page=1&filters=fulfillment_options&fulfillment_options=SAGEMAKER)

To know more about algorithms and model packages from AWS Marketplace, see [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/machine-learning-products.html)

#### Create algorithms/model packages for listing in AWS Marketplace for machine learning.

This example notebook shows you how to package a model-package/algorithm for listing in AWS Marketplace for machine learning.

- [Creating Algorithm and Model Package - Listing on AWS Marketplace](creating_marketplace_products) provides a detailed walkthrough on how to package a scikit learn algorithm to create SageMaker Algorithm and SageMaker Model Package entities that can be used with the enhanced SageMaker Train/Transform/Hosting/Tuning APIs and listed on AWS Marketplace.

Once you have created an algorithm or a model package to be listed in the AWS Marketplace, the next step is to list it in AWS Marketplace, and provide a sample notebook that users can use to try your algorithm or model package. 

* [Curate your AWS Marketplace algorithm listing and sample notebook](curating_aws_marketplace_listing_and_sample_notebook/Algorithm) provides instructions on how to craft a sample notebook to be associated with your listing and how to curate a good AWS Marketplace listing that makes it easy for your customers to consume your algorithm.

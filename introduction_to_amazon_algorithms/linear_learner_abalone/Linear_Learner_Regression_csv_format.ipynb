    "This notebook demonstrates the use of Amazon SageMakerâ€™s implementation of the Linear Learner algorithm to train and host a regression model. We use the [Abalone data](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/regression.html) originally from the [UCI data repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone). \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 9 fields, starting with the Rings number which is a number indicating the age of the abalone (as age equals to number of rings plus 1.5). Usually the number of rings are counted through microscopes to estimate the abalone's age. So we will use our algorithm to predict the abalone age based on the other features which are mentioned respectively as below within the dataset. \n",

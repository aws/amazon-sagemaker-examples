    "\n",
    "Welcome to our example introducing Amazon SageMaker's Factorization Machines Algorithm!  Today, we're analyzing the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset which consists of images of handwritten digits, from zero to nine.  We'll use the individual pixel values from each 28 x 28 grayscale image to predict a yes or no label of whether the digit is a 0 or some other digit (1, 2, 3, ... 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that we'll use is a factorization machine binary classifier.  A factorization machine is a general-purpose supervised learning algorithm that you which can use for both classification and regression tasks.  It is an extension of a linear model that is designed to parsimoniously capture interactions between features in high dimensional sparse datasets.  For example, in a click prediction system, the factorization machine model can capture click rate patterns observed when ads from a certain ad-category are placed on pages from a certain page-category.  Factorization machines are a good choice for tasks dealing with high dimensional sparse datasets, such as click prediction and item recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker's Factorization Machine algorithm provides a robust, highly scalable implementation of this algorithm, which has become extremely popular in ad click prediction and recommender systems.  The main purpose of this notebook is to quickly show the basics of implementing Amazon SageMaker Factorization Machines, even if the use case of predicting a digit from an image is not where factorization machines shine.\n",

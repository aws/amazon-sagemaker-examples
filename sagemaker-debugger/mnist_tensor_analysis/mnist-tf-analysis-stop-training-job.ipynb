    "# Amazon SageMaker - Reacting To Rule Triggers\n",
    "[SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is managed platform to build, train and host maching learning models. SageMaker Debugger is a new feature which offers the capability to debug machine learning models during training by identifying and detecting problems with the models in near real time. \n",
    "Rules help identify issues with the training job by analyzing tensors captured in the training execution in near real time (You can find some examples of how to create and define Debugger Rules [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-debugger).)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll show you how you can react off rule triggers and take some action, e.g. stop the training job through CloudWatch Events\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does SageMaker Debugger work?\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker Debugger lets you go beyond just looking at scalars like losses and accuracies during training and gives you full visibility into all tensors 'flowing through the graph' during training. Furthermore, it helps you monitor your training in near real time using rules and would provide you alerts, once it has detected inconsistency in training flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts\n",
    "* **Tensors**: These represent the state of the network at intermediate points during its execution\n",
    "* **Debug Hook**: Captures the tensors flowing through the training computational graph every N steps.\n",
    "* **Debugging Rule**: Logic to analyze the tensors captured by the hook and report anamolies, if at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these concepts in mind, let's understand the overall flow of things which the Debugger uses to orchestrate debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage of tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "The tensors captured by the debug hook are stored in an S3 location specified by you. There are two ways you can configure the Debugger for storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With no changes to your training script\n",
    "If you use any one of SageMaker provided [Deep Learning Containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html) then you don't need to make any changes to your training script for the tensors to be stored. SageMaker Debugger will use the configuration you provide in the framework `Estimator` to save the tensors in the fashion you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Orchestrating your script to store tensors\n",
    " The Debugger exposes a library which allows you to capture these tensors and save them for analysis. It's highly customizable and allows to save the specific tensors you want at different frequencies and possibly with other configurations. Refer [DeveloperGuide](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/tree/master/docs) for details on how to use the Debugger library with your choice of framework in your training script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the tensors are saved, the Debugger can be configured to run debugging ***Rules*** on them. On a very broad level, a rule is a python code used to detect certain conditions during training. Some of the conditions that a data scientist training an algorithm may care about are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on. Sagemaker-Debugger will come pre-packaged with certain first-party (1P) rules. Users can write their own rules using the Sagemaker-Debugger APIs. You can also analyze raw tensor data outside of the Rules construct in say, a Sagemaker notebook, using Sagemaker-Debugger's full set of APIs.\n",

    "Follow this one time setup to get your notebook up and running to use SageMaker Debugger"

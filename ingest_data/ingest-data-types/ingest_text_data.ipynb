In these cases, you may have one column for the label, one column for the text, and sometimes other columns for attributes. You can treat this structured data like tabular data.

For `pandas`, any valid string path is acceptable. The string could be a URL. Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, and file. For file URLs, a host is expected.

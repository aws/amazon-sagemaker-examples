    "2. Run a training job on the pre-processed training data to train a model\n",

    "The dataset used here is the [Census-Income KDD Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+%28KDD%29). You select features from this dataset, clean the data, and turn the data into features that the training algorithm can use to train a binary classification model, and split the data into train and test sets. The task is to predict whether rows representing census responders have an income greater than `$50,000`, or less than `$50,000`. The dataset is heavily class imbalanced, with most records being labeled as earning less than `$50,000`. After training a logistic regression model, you evaluate the model against a hold-out test dataset, and save the classification evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score for each label, and accuracy and ROC AUC for the model."

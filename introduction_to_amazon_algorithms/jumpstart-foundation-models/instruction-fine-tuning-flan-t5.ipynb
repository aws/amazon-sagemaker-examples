    "Welcome to Amazon [SageMaker JumpStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html)! You can use SageMaker JumpStart to solve many Machine Learning tasks through one-click in SageMaker Studio, or through [SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-prebuilt-models-with-sagemaker-jumpstart).\n",

The prompt can include a task description in natural language. Accordingly, the model can be used for a variety of NLP tasks (e.g., text summarization, question answering, etc.).\n",

    "We will fine-tune a pre-trained **FLAN T5 model** from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5). While pre-trained FLAN T5 models can be used \"as is\" for many tasks, fine-tuning can improve model performance on a particular task or language domain. As an example, we will fine-tune the model for a task that was not used for pre-training. After fine-tuning we will deploy two inference endpoints, one with a pre-trained and one with a fine-tuned model. We will then run the same inference query against both endpoints and compare results.\n",

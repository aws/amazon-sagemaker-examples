# Amazon SageMaker Feature Store

## Introduction to Feature Store
In `feature_store_introduction.ipynb` we demonstrate how to get started with Feature Store, create feature groups, and ingest data into them.

This notebook requires these data sets, `./data/customer.csv`, `./data/orders.csv`, and uses these images, `./images/feature-store-policy.png`, `./images/feature_store_data_ingest.svg`.


## Fraud Detection with Feature Store

    "# Time-series quantile selection example\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This workflow highlights the capability to blend together customer provided item-metadata along with quantile forecasts from backtesting periods to determine the quantile likely to generate the most amount of profit in future periods, all other things in the world being the same.  A sample, fictitious dataset and a flow file are provided to help demonstrate the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required input data: time-series backtest predictions\n",
    "This set of data would be produced by your time-series forecaster. In this case, this sample file structure was produced by Amazon Forecast, landing data on Amazon S3.  An important note is this is data held out from training data.  Models are trained on data that predates the `backtestwindow_start_time`. Out-of-sample predictions enable various quantiles to be expressed next to the known target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column Name  | Description  | \n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| `item_id`*  | unique id representing finished material, finished good or SKU \n",
    "| `region` | in the dataset provided, this is a fictitious region\n",
    "| `timestamp`* | period of the historic prediction \n",
    "| `target_value`* | known, actual true value from held back history training data   \n",
    "| `backtestwindow_start_time` | start of backtesting period in historical data\n",
    "| `backtestwindow_end_time` | end of backtesting period in historical data\n",
    "| `p50`** | estimated value at the quantile 50; 50% of the time, actual value will be less than this value; 50% of the time, actual value will be greater than this value\n",
    "| `p60`** | estimated value at the quantile 60; 60% of the time, actual value will be less than this value; 40% of the time, actual value will be greater than this value\n",
    "| `p70`** | estimated value at the quantile 70; 70% of the time, actual value will be less than this value; 30% of the time, actual value will be greater than this value\n",
    "| `p80`** | estimated value at the quantile 80; 80% of the time, actual value will be less than this value; 20% of the time, actual value will be greater than this value\n",

    "\n",
    "`*` Conceptually, a required field\n",
    "`**` You should have 2 or more quantiles in your data. In this example five are shown, but the range of values and quantity should be of your choosing.  More quantiles enable more points to examine where the profitability curve meets its apex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required input data: customer provided financial metadata file\n",
    "This set of data is meant to illustrate capability and is placed on S3 for purposes of this demonstration. Customers may elect to alter this structure, making it more or less complex according to need. Additionally, customers may elect to store the data in a database as opposed to S3.  Amazon Data Wrangler has an ability to source data from a myriad of source databases and more than 40 other SaaS endpoints, when needed.\n",

    "| `item_cost_of_goods` | the all-in cost to manufacture or purchase the item from supplier(s)\n",
    "| `item_holding_cost` | for unsold items, this cost represents the annualized cost of warehouse, storage, handling to carry the item in inventory\n",
    "| `item_salvage_cost` | Salvage cost represents the value of the item if unsold. If the product spoils, salvage cost may be zero.  If the item is shelf-stable, salvage cost might represent a clearance/final sale amount. Range of values should be from a low of `0` to a high of `item_value`\n",

    "## Getting your files ready\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the following Data Wrangler flow file to your laptop. You can also `git clone` to obtain the file, if you prefer. In a next step, you will upload this file to your SageMaker Studio environment.\n",
    "\t- [Quantile-Selector.flow](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sagemaker-sample-files/datasets/tabular/timeseries-quantile-selection-dataflow/Quantile-Selector.flow)\n",

    "## Adjust transform: filter to last N-periods\n",
    "In the Data Wrangler flow, you will see a transform labeled `filter to last N-periods`.  Double-click the transform to edit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As delivered, this transform will compare the timestamp in the input forecast file against \"today\" and remove any observations prior to 36 months ago.  You can wholly remove this step, or edit the time-period according to your use case.  If you filter the data to very recent periods only, then quantile selection will be more sensitive to recent periods.  Allowing a wider range takes a more holistic view, including viewing prior season.  Apply discretion here to make the best decision for your specific case.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this step can be used to filter backtest data to only a recent period when desired\n",
    "# this allows the quantile selection to be more responsive\n",
    "# CAUTION: this is defaulting to 36 months ago; change this setting accordingly\n",

    " \n",
    "## Adjust transform: compute-quantile-financial\n",
    "As with the prior transform, you may decide to edit the quantile computation logic.  This is located in a transform titled `compute-quantile-financial`. Here, we see an example of a dataset that shows backtest forecasted values, financial profit and loss measures, and the winner quantile (including customer override), among quantiles tested.\n",

As shown in the picture below, you can setup S3 locations where the results of each transform can be saved for subsequent use in your data pipeline.  In this section, the goal is to add S3 destinations, which ultimately, will write data to your own S3 bucket. In this example, the goal is to add multiple destinations to your sample Data Wrangler workflow as follows.\n",

You may not need the quantile based output files and can delete these, if appropriate.  The purpose of these distinct files is to use them to drive Amazon Forecast such that it produces future forecasts, at specific quantiles, for named items as a cost efficiency measure.

    "This example of **multi-label image classification** trains the **Amazon SageMaker 1P image classification algorithm**. We will use the Amazon SageMaker image classification algorithm in transfer learning mode to fine-tune a pre-trained model (trained on ImageNet data) to learn to classify a new multi-label dataset. The pre-trained model will be fine-tuned using the [Free Sample: Images & Metadata of “Whole Foods” Shoppers dataset from Shutterstock’s Image Datasets](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-y6xuddt42fmbu?ref_=srh_res_product_title). \n",

You can subscribe to one of the preexisting collections, such as Food & Beverage, Clothing, or Hospitality, or you can work with the Shutterstock Data Exchange team to request a custom collection of images for your use case. Each image includes a descriptive title with up to 200 characters and an optimal 7-50 keywords. \n",

This dataset contains images of Whole Foods shoppers. Each image is tagged with 30-50 keywords describing what is seen in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "An image can contain objects of multiple keywords. Because the purpose of this notebook is to show how the Shutterstock dataset can be used to train for multi-label image classification, we will limit the keywords that we are training on for demonstration purposes. We have a limited set of 200 images in our free sample.\n",

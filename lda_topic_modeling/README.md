# Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Topic Modeling

Example notebooks on using Amazon SageMaker to train and use LDA models.

* **LDA - Rosetta Stone** - An end-to-end example of generating training data,
  uploading to an S3 bucket, training an LDA model, turning the model into an
  endpoint, and inferring topic mixtures using the endpoint.
* **LDA - Science** - A deep dive into the science of LDA using Amazon
  SageMaker.

    "Losing customers is costly for any business.  Identifying unhappy customers early on gives you a chance to offer them incentives to stay.  This notebook describes using machine learning (ML) for the automated identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction. ML models rarely give perfect predictions though, so this notebook is also about how to incorporate the relative costs of prediction mistakes when determining the financial outcome of using ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a familiar example of churn: leaving a mobile phone operator.  Seems like one can always find fault with their provider du jour! And if the provider knows that a customer is thinking of leaving, it can offer timely incentives - such as a phone upgrade or perhaps having a new feature activated – and the customer may stick around. Incentives are often much more cost-effective than losing and reacquiring a customer.\n",

    "Mobile operators have historical records on which customers ultimately ended up churning and which continued using the service. We can use this historical information to construct an ML model of one mobile operator’s churn using a process called training. After training the model, we can pass the profile information of an arbitrary customer (the same profile information that we used to train the model) to the model, and have the model predict whether this customer is going to churn. Of course, we expect the model to make mistakes. After all, predicting the future is tricky business! But we'll learn how to deal with prediction errors.\n",

    "Now that we've cleaned up our dataset, let's determine which algorithm to use.  As mentioned above, there appear to be some variables where both high and low (but not intermediate) values are predictive of churn.  In order to accommodate this in an algorithm like linear regression, we'd need to generate polynomial (or bucketed) terms.  Instead, let's attempt to model this problem using gradient boosted trees.  Amazon SageMaker provides an XGBoost container that we can use to train in a managed, distributed setting, and then host as a real-time prediction endpoint.  XGBoost uses gradient boosted trees which naturally account for non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, as well as accommodating complex interactions between features.\n",

    "We can see that lowering the cutoff from 0.5 to 0.3 results in 1 more true positive, 3 more false positives, and 1 fewer false negative. The numbers are small overall here, but that's 6-10% of customers overall that are shifting because of a change to the cutoff.  Was this the right decision?  We may end up retaining 3 extra customers, but we also unnecessarily incentivized 5 more customers who would have stayed anyway.  Determining optimal cutoffs is a key step in properly applying machine learning in a real-world setting.  Let's discuss this more broadly and then apply a specific, hypothetical solution for our current problem.\n",

    "Any practical binary classification problem is likely to produce a similarly sensitive cutoff. That by itself isn’t a problem. After all, if the scores for two classes are really easy to separate, the problem probably isn’t very hard to begin with and might even be solvable with deterministic rules instead of ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "More important, if we put an ML model into production, there are costs associated with the model erroneously assigning false positives and false negatives. We also need to look at similar costs associated with correct predictions of true positives and true negatives.  Because the choice of the cutoff affects all four of these statistics, we need to consider the relative costs to the business for each of these four outcomes for each prediction.\n",

    "#### Assigning costs\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the costs for our problem of mobile operator churn? The costs, of course, depend on the specific actions that the business takes. Let's make some assumptions here.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, assign the true negatives the cost of \\$0. Our model essentially correctly identified a happy customer in this case, and we don’t need to do anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "False negatives are the most problematic, because they incorrectly predict that a churning customer will stay. We lose the customer and will have to pay all the costs of acquiring a replacement customer, including foregone revenue, advertising costs, administrative costs, point of sale costs, and likely a phone hardware subsidy. A quick search on the Internet reveals that such costs typically run in the hundreds of dollars so, for the purposes of this example, let's assume \\$500. This is the cost of false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for customers that our model identifies as churning, let's assume a retention incentive in the amount of \\\\$100. If a provider offered a customer such a concession, they may think twice before leaving. This is the cost of both true positive and false positive outcomes. In the case of false positives (the customer is happy, but the model mistakenly predicted churn), we will “waste” the \\\\$100 concession. We probably could have spent that \\$100 more effectively, but it's possible we increased the loyalty of an already loyal customer, so that’s not so bad."

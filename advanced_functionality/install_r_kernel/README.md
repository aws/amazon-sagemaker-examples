# Installing the R Kernel

This folder contains two notebooks:

*install_r_kernel.ipynb:* shows how easy it is to install the R kernel in SageMaker's hosted notebook environment.  It depends on `conda install` being accessible by the user and therefore is not guaranteed to work in situations outside of SageMaker's hosted notebook environment.

*example_r_notebook.ipynb:* is an extremely brief demonstration of how to use R in the notebook once installed.

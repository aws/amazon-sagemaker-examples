    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate a Predictive Maintenance (PrM) solution for automible fleet maintenance via Amazon SageMaker Studio so that business users have a quick path towards a PrM POC. In this notebook, we focus on preprocessing engine sensor data before feature engineering and buidling an inital model leveraging SageMaker's algorithms. This notebook will cover the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Setup for using SageMaker\n",
    "* Basic data cleaning, analysis and preprocessing\n",
    "* Converting datasets to format used by the Amazon SageMaker algorithms and uploading to S3 \n",
    "* Training SageMaker's linear learner on the dataset\n",
    "* Hyperparamter tuning using SageMaker Automatic Tuning\n",
    "* Deploying and getting predictions using Batch Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Due to cost consideration, the goal of this example is to show you how to use some of SageMaker Studio's features, not necessarily to achieve the best result. \n",
    "* We use the built-in classification algorithm in this example, and a Python 3 (Data Science) Kernel is required.\n",
    "* The nature of predictive maintenace solutions, requires a domain knowledge expert of the system or machinery. With this in mind, we will make assumptions here for certain elements of this solution with the acknowldgement that these assumptions should be informed by a domain expert and a main business stakeholder\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the README.md for more information about this use case. "

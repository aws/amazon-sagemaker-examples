    "Welcome to Amazon [SageMaker JumpStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html)! You can use SageMaker JumpStart to solve many Machine Learning tasks through one-click in SageMaker Studio, or through [SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-prebuilt-models-with-sagemaker-jumpstart).\n",

    "In this demo notebook, we use the SageMaker Python SDK to **fine-tune a Text2Text model**. Such a model takes prompting text as input and generates text as output. The prompt can include a task description in natural language. Accordingly, the model can be used for a variety of NLP tasks (e.g., text summarization, question answering, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will fine-tune a pre-trained **FLAN T5 model** from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5). While pre-trained FLAN T5 models can be used \"as is\" for many tasks, fine-tuning can improve model performance on a particular task or language domain. As an example, we will fine-tune the model for a task that was not used for pre-training. After fine-tuning we will deploy two inference endpoints, one with a pre-trained and one with a fine-tuned model. We will then run the same inference query against both endpoints and compare results.\n",

    "Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances. EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance. You can create a file system on top of these volumes, or use them in any way you would use a block device (such as a hard drive). You can dynamically change the configuration of a volume attached to an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend Amazon EBS for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage. Amazon EBS is well suited to both database-style applications that rely on random reads and writes, and to throughput-intensive applications that perform long, continuous reads and writes.\n",

    "Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights about the content of documents. It develops insights by recognizing the entities, key phrases, language, sentiments, and other common elements in a document. Use Amazon Comprehend to create new products based on understanding the structure of documents. For example, using Amazon Comprehend you can search social networking feeds for mentions of products or scan an entire document repository for key phrases. \n",
    "You can access Amazon Comprehend document analysis capabilities using the Amazon Comprehend console or using the Amazon Comprehend APIs. You can run real-time analysis for small workloads or you can start asynchronous analysis jobs for large document sets. You can use the pre-trained models that Amazon Comprehend provides, or you can train your own custom models for classification and entity recognition. \n",
    "All of the Amazon Comprehend features accept UTF-8 text documents as the input. In addition, custom classification and custom entity recognition accept image files, PDF files, and Word files as input. \n",
    "Amazon Comprehend can examine and analyze documents in a variety of languages, depending on the specific feature. For more information, see Languages supported in Amazon Comprehend. Amazon Comprehend's Dominant language capability can examine documents and determine the dominant language for a far wider selection of languages.\n",

    "Amazon SageMaker provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for ML. Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that encompasses the entire ML workflow. You can label and prepare your data, choose an algorithm, train a model, and then tune and optimize it for deployment. You can deploy your models to production with Amazon SageMaker to make predictions and lower costs than it was previously possible.\n",

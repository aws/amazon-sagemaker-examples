The predicted_label is the class predicted by the model and the score measures the strength of that prediction.

But if the `loss` is set to `hinge_loss`, then the score cannot be interpreted as a probability.

In the current example, since our loss hyperparameter is logistic for binary classification, we can interpret it as probability of the corresponding class."

We provide two methods of dimension reduction methods: random projection and the fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform. Typically, you use dimension reduction for high-dimensional (d >1000) datasets to avoid the “curse of dimensionality” that troubles the statistical analysis of data that becomes sparse as dimensionality increases. The main objective of k-NN's training is to construct the index. The index enables efficient lookups of distances between points whose values or class labels have not yet been determined and the k nearest points to use for inference.\n",

    "When you make predictions on new data, the contents of the response data depends on the type of model you choose within Linear Learner. For regression (predictor_type='regressor'), the score is the prediction produced by the model. For classification (predictor_type='binary_classifier' or predictor_type='multiclass_classifier'), the model returns a score and also a predicted_label. The predicted_label is the class predicted by the model and the score measures the strength of that prediction. So, for binary classification, predicted_label is 0 or 1, and score is a single floating point number that indicates how strongly the algorithm believes that the label should be 1.\n",

    "To interpret the score in classification problems, you have to consider the loss function used. If the loss hyperparameter value is logistic for binary classification or softmax_loss for multiclass classification, then the score can be interpreted as the probability of the corresponding class. These are the loss values used by the linear learner when the loss hyperparameter is set to auto as default value. But if the loss is set to hinge_loss, then the score cannot be interpreted as a probability. This is because hinge loss corresponds to a Support Vector Classifier, which does not produce probability estimates. In the current example, since our loss hyperparameter is logistic for binary classification, we can interpret it as probability of the corresponding class."

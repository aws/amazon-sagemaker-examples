AWS DeepRacer
=============

Use RL to train an autonomous AWS DeepRacer. This is a jailbreaker for the AWS DeepRacer; it gives a glimpse at the architecture used to get the DeepRacer working.

Cart pole
=========

A cart pole simulation is the act of balancing a broom upright by balancing it on your hand.
The broom is the "pole" and your hand is replaced with a "cart" moving back and forth on a linear track.
This simplified example works in 2 dimensions, so the cart can only move in a line back and forth, and the pole can only fall forwards or backwards, not to the sides.
These examples use PyTorch or TensorFlow and SageMaker RL to solve a cart pole problem.

Use cases
=========

Autoscaling
-----------

This example demonstrates how to use RL to address scaling a production service by adding and removing resources (e.g. servers or EC2 instances) in reaction to a dynamic load.

Energy
------

Training an RL algorithm in a real HVAC system can take time to converge as well as potentially lead to hazardous settings as the agent explores its state space.
This example uses the `EnergyPlus <https://energyplus.net/>`_ simulator to showcase how you can train an HVAC optimization RL model with Amazon SageMaker.

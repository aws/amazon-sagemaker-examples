    "Amazon SageMaker Clarify helps improve your machine learning models by detecting potential bias and helping explain how these models make predictions. The fairness and explainability functionality provided by SageMaker Clarify takes a step towards enabling AWS customers to build trustworthy and understandable machine learning models. The product comes with the tools to help you with the following tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measure biases that can occur during each stage of the ML lifecycle (data collection, model training and tuning, and monitoring of ML models deployed for inference).\n",
    "* Generate model governance reports targeting risk and compliance teams and external regulators.\n",
    "* Provide explanations of the data, models, and monitoring used to assess predictions for input containing data of various modalities like numerical data, categorical data, text, and images. \n",

    "In doing so, the notebook will first train a [Hugging Face model](https://huggingface.co/models) using the [Hugging Face Estimator](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/huggingface/sagemaker.huggingface.html) in the SageMaker Python SDK using the training dataset, then use SageMaker Clarify to analyze a testing dataset in CSV format, and then visualize the results."

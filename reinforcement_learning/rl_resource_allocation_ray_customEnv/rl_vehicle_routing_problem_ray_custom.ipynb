    "In this notebook, you will see how reinforcement learning can be used to solve a Vehicle Routing Probelm (VRP). Given one or more vehicles and a set of locations, VRP tries to find the route that reaches all locations with minimal operational cost. This problem has been of great interest for decades, as it has a wide application in logistics, parcel delivery, and more. It has many variants that characterize different constraints or features, among which online and stochastic version is considered in this example."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a delivery driver using a phone app, orders arrive on the app in a dynamic manner. Each order has a delivery charge known to the driver at the time of order creation, and it is assigned to a location in the city. The city is a grid map and consists of mutually exclusive zones that generate orders at different rates and rewards. The orders have a delivery time limit, the timer starts with the order creation and is same for all orders. The driver has to accept an order and pick up the package from a given location prior to delivery. The vehicle has a capacity limit, but the driver can accept unlimited orders and plan their route accordingly. The driver’s goal is to maximize the total net reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation is known as stochastic and dynamic capacitated vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery, time windows and service guarantee."

    "- Accept an order\n",

    "- Head to a specific pickup location\n",

    "At each time step, the reward is defined as the difference between total value of all delivered orders and cost:\n",

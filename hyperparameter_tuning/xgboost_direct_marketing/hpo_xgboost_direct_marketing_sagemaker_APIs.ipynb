    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",

    "Cleaning up data is part of nearly every machine learning project.  It arguably presents the biggest risk if done incorrectly and is one of the more subjective aspects in the process.  Several common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling missing values: Some machine learning algorithms are capable of handling missing values, but most would rather not.  Options include:\n",
    " * Removing observations with missing values: This works well if only a very small fraction of observations have incomplete information.\n",
    " * Removing features with missing values: This works well if there are a small number of features which have a large number of missing values.\n",
    " * Imputing missing values: Entire [books](https://www.amazon.com/Flexible-Imputation-Missing-Interdisciplinary-Statistics/dp/1439868247) have been written on this topic, but common choices are replacing the missing value with the mode or mean of that column's non-missing values.\n",
    "* Converting categorical to numeric: The most common method is one hot encoding, which for each feature maps every distinct value of that column to its own feature which takes a value of 1 when the categorical feature is equal to that value, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "* Oddly distributed data: Although for non-linear models like Gradient Boosted Trees, this has very limited implications, parametric models like regression can produce wildly inaccurate estimates when fed highly skewed data.  In some cases, simply taking the natural log of the features is sufficient to produce more normally distributed data.  In others, bucketing values into discrete ranges is helpful.  These buckets can then be treated as categorical variables and included in the model when one hot encoded.\n",
    "* Handling more complicated data types: Mainpulating images, text, or data at varying grains.\n",

    "*Note, with the default setting below, the hyperparameter tuning job can take about 30 minutes to complete.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have prepared the dataset, we are ready to train models. Before we do that, one thing to note is there are algorithm settings which are called \"hyperparameters\" that can dramtically affect the performance of the trained models. For example, XGBoost algorithm has dozens of hyperparameters and we need to pick the right values for those hyperparameters in order to achieve the desired model training results. Since which hyperparameter setting can lead to the best result depends on the dataset as well, it is almost impossible to pick the best hyperparameter setting without searching for it, and a good search algorithm can search for the best hyperparameter setting in an automated and effective way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use SageMaker hyperparameter tuning to automate the searching process effectively. Specifically, we specify a range, or a list of possible values in the case of categorical hyperparameters, for each of the hyperparameter that we plan to tune. SageMaker hyperparameter tuning will automatically launch multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter settings, evaluate results of those training jobs based on a predefined \"objective metric\", and select the hyperparameter settings for future attempts based on previous results. For each hyperparameter tuning job, we will give it a budget (max number of training jobs) and it will complete once that many training jobs have been executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we configure the hyperparameter tuning job by defining a JSON object that specifies following information:\n",
    "* The ranges of hyperparameters we want to tune\n",
    "* Number of training jobs to run in total and how many training jobs should be run simultaneously. More parallel jobs will finish tuning sooner, but may sacrifice accuracy. We recommend you set the parallel jobs value to less than 10% of the total number of training jobs (we'll set it higher just for this example to keep it short).\n",
    "* The objective metric that will be used to evaluate training results, in this example, we select *validation:auc* to be the objective metric and the goal is to maximize the value throughout the hyperparameter tuning process. One thing to note is the objective metric has to be among the metrics that are emitted by the algorithm during training. In this example, the built-in XGBoost algorithm emits a bunch of metrics and *validation:auc* is one of them. If you bring your own algorithm to SageMaker, then you need to make sure whatever objective metric you select, your algorithm actually emits it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will tune four hyperparameters in this examples:\n",
    "* *eta*: Step size shrinkage used in updates to prevent overfitting. After each boosting step, you can directly get the weights of new features. The eta parameter actually shrinks the feature weights to make the boosting process more conservative. \n",
    "* *alpha*: L1 regularization term on weights. Increasing this value makes models more conservative. \n",
    "* *min_child_weight*: Minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child. If the tree partition step results in a leaf node with the sum of instance weight less than min_child_weight, the building process gives up further partitioning. In linear regression models, this simply corresponds to a minimum number of instances needed in each node. The larger the algorithm, the more conservative it is. \n",
    "* *max_depth*: Maximum depth of a tree. Increasing this value makes the model more complex and likely to be overfitted. "

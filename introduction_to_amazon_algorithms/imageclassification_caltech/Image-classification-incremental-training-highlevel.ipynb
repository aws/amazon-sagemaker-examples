    "Welcome to our end-to-end example of incremental training using Amazon Sagemaker image classification algorithm. In this demo, we will use the Amazon sagemaker image classification algorithm to train on the [Caltech-256 dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/caltech-256). First, we will run the training for few epochs. Then, we will use the generated model in the previous training to start another training to improve accuracy further without re-training again. \n",

    "Download the data and transfer to S3 for use in training. In this demo, we are using Caltech-256 dataset, which contains 30608 images of 256 objects. For the training and validation data, we follow the splitting scheme in this MXNet [example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/data/caltech256.sh). In particular, it randomly selects 60 images per class for training, and uses the remaining data for validation. The algorithm takes `RecordIO` file as input. The user can also provide the image files as input, which will be converted into `RecordIO` format using MXNet's [im2rec](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/how_to/recordio.html?highlight=im2rec) tool. It takes under a minute to convert the entire Caltech-256 dataset (~1.2GB) on a p3.2xlarge instance. However, for this demo, we will use record io format. "

    "# Amazon SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoints using your own algorithm container\n",
    "With [Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/multi-model-endpoints.html), customers can create an endpoint that seamlessly hosts up to thousands of models. These endpoints are well suited to use cases where any one of a large number of models, which can be served from a common inference container, needs to be invokable on-demand and where it is acceptable for infrequently invoked models to incur some additional latency. For applications which require consistently low inference latency, a traditional endpoint is still the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, Amazon SageMaker manages the loading and unloading of models for a multi-model endpoint, as they are needed. When an invocation request is made for a particular model, Amazon SageMaker routes the request to an instance assigned to that model, downloads the model artifacts from S3 onto that instance, and initiates loading of the model into the memory of the container. As soon as the loading is complete, Amazon SageMaker performs the requested invocation and returns the result. If the model is already loaded in memory on the selected instance, the downloading and loading steps are skipped and the invocation is performed immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the inference container to serve multiple models in a multi-model endpoint, it must implement [additional APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-multi-model-build-container.html) in order to load, list, get, unload and invoke specific models. This notebook demonstrates how to build your own inference container that implements these APIs.\n",

    "## Introduction to Multi Model Server (MMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Multi Model Server](https://github.com/awslabs/multi-model-server) is an open source framework for serving machine learning models. It provides the HTTP frontend and model management capabilities required by multi-model endpoints to host multiple models within a single container, load models into and unload models out of the container dynamically, and performing inference on a specified loaded model.\n",
    "\n",
    "MMS supports a pluggable custom backend handler where you can implement your own algorithm. This example uses a handler that supports loading and inference for MXNet models, which we will inspect below."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Of note are the `handle(data, context)` and `initialize(self, context)` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `initialize` method will be called when a model is loaded into memory. In this example, it loads the model artifacts at `model_dir` into MXNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `handle` method will be called when invoking the model. In this example, it validates the input payload and then forwards the input to MXNet, returning the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This handler class is instantiated for every model loaded into the container, so state in the handler is not shared across models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Out Of Memory conditions\n",
    "If MXNet fails to load the model due to lack of memory, a `MemoryError` is raised. Any time a model cannot be loaded due to lack of memory or any other resource constraint, a `MemoryError` must be raised. MMS will interpret the `MemoryError`, and return a 507 HTTP status code to SageMaker, where SageMaker will initiate unloading unused models to reclaim resources so the requested model can be loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SageMaker Inference Toolkit\n",
    "MMS supports [various settings](https://github.com/awslabs/multi-model-server/blob/master/docker/advanced_settings.md#description-of-config-file-settings) for the frontend server it starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SageMaker Inference Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-inference-toolkit) is a library that bootstraps MMS in a way that is compatible with SageMaker multi-model endpoints, while still allowing you to tweak important performance parameters, such as the number of workers per model. The inference container in this example uses the Inference Toolkit to start MMS which can be seen in the __`container/dockerd-entrypoint.py`__ file."

    "### Updating a model\n",
    "To update a model, you would follow the same approach as above and add it as a new model. For example, if you have retrained the `resnet_18.tar.gz` model and wanted to start invoking it, you would upload the updated model artifacts behind the S3 prefix with a new name such as `resnet_18_v2.tar.gz`, and then change the `TargetModel` field to invoke `resnet_18_v2.tar.gz` instead of `resnet_18.tar.gz`. You do not want to overwrite the model artifacts in Amazon S3, because the old version of the model might still be loaded in the containers or on the storage volume of the instances on the endpoint. Invocations to the new model could then invoke the old version of the model."

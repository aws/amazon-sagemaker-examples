    "# Implementing a Recommender System for Implicit Feedback Datasets with Bayesian Personalized Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Introduction of recommender systems:\n",
    "A Recommender system is an automated form of software mechanism that leverages the algorithms and data to improve the discovery of the products or items that are most relevant to a particular user. Their task is not only to reveal to users the items they are looking for but also personalize their experience based on various techniques, such as:\n",
    "1. Leveraging past interactions/purchases/likes of this user.\n",
    "1. A recommendation based on other user's similarity to this user and what they liked/purchased.\n",
    "1. A recommendation based on their demographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, recommender systems are employed in diverse domains to promote items such as products on e-commerce sites like **Amazon.com**, movie recommendations on **Netflix**, music/artist/album recommendations, or even on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./images/customer-who-bought-this.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Classes of recommender systems:\n",
    "1. **Content-based recommender systems**: Rely on the product's features, attributes, and descriptions to recommend other products that are similar to their past purchases or any form of explicit feedback data.\n",
    "2. **Personalized Ranking-based recommender systems**: Recommend the top-n items for a particular user along with a ranking and a score.\n",
    "3. **Collaborating Filtering-based recommender systems**: Rely on the user's prior item interactions or ratings to make a recommendation\n",
    "    1. User-based: Operate by discovering the other identical/like-minded users.\n",
    "    2. Item-based: Works based on the similarity between items assessed using user's ratings of those items/ interactions.\n",
    "4. **Location/Demographics**: The user's demographic knowledge is applied to acquire a classifier that can outline particular demographics to ratings or purchasing capacities.\n",
    "5. **Hybrid**: A blend of more than one of the above strategies.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explicit vs. Implicit Users Feedback:\n",
    "1. **Explicit Feedback**: A dataset collected primarily based on the user's behavior or explicitly posted by the user in the system, so-called explicit feedback. Examples include movie ratings on Netflix, provided explicitly by the users, or ratings of products by users on Amazon.com.\n",
    "2. **Implicit Feedback**: Rather than relying on explicit user feedback, the system can indirectly utilize user behavior and interactions to learn about their interests and choices. This implicit feedback is handy in many different domains.  For instance, the system may see a user purchasing or browsing an item as an endorsement for that item or even the number of times they played a particular song.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) and its significance:\n",
    "Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) is an implicit feedback algorithm optimization technique that deals with one-class collaborative filtering problem by transforming them into a ranking task. The general strategy for item recommenders is to predict a personalized score for an item revealing its inclination. Then the items are arranged by ordering them according to that score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically with the traditional recommender system, as the name suggests, the critical function is to recommend items to the users; however, when all those recommended items are alike, it raises theÂ user's uncertainty. While employing the BPR algorithm, the recommendation comprises different types and their relevance score based on the implicit dataset. This increases the chances of the user liking at least one of those items. This increases the opportunities of the user getting recommendations containing a diverse selection of items. It also positively influences the user experience, which interprets into more challenging to measure metrics such as customer satisfaction and retention.\n",

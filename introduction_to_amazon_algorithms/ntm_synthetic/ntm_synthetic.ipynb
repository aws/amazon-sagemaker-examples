    "Amazon SageMaker NTM (Neural Topic Model) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to describe a set of observations as a mixture of distinct categories. NTM is most commonly used to discover a user-specified number of topics shared by documents within a text corpus. Here each observation is a document, the features are the presence (or occurrence count) of each word, and the categories are the topics. Since the method is unsupervised, the topics are not specified up front, and are not guaranteed to align with how a human may naturally categorize documents. The topics are learned as a probability distribution over the words that occur in each document. Each document, in turn, is described as a mixture of topics.\n",

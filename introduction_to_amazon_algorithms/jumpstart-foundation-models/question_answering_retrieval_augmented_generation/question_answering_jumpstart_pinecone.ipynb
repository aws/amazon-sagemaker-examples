      "To get started with Amazon SageMaker Edge Manager, you need to compile and package your trained ML models in the cloud, register your devices, and prepare your devices with the SageMaker Edge Manager SDK. To prepare your model for deployment, SageMaker Edge Manager uses SageMaker Neo to compile your model for your target edge hardware. Once a model is compiled, SageMaker Edge Manager signs the model with an AWS generated key, then packages the model with its runtime and your necessary credentials to get it ready for deployment. On the device side, you register your device with SageMaker Edge Manager, download the SageMaker Edge Manager SDK, and then follow the instructions to install the SageMaker Edge Manager agent on your devices. The tutorial notebook provides a step-by-step example of how you can prepare the models and connect your models on edge devices with SageMaker Edge Manager.\n"

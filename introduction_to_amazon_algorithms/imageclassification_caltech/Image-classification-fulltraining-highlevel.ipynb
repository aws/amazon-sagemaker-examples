    "Download the data and transfer to S3 for use in training. In this demo, we are using [Caltech-256](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/) dataset, which contains 30608 images of 256 objects. For the training and validation data, we follow the splitting scheme in this MXNet [example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/data/caltech256.sh). In particular, it randomly selects 60 images per class for training, and uses the remaining data for validation. The algorithm takes `RecordIO` file as input. The user can also provide the image files as input, which will be converted into `RecordIO` format using MXNet's [im2rec](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/how_to/recordio.html?highlight=im2rec) tool. It takes around 50 seconds to converted the entire Caltech-256 dataset (~1.2GB) on a p2.xlarge instance. However, for this demo, we will use record io format. "

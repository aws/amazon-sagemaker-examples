    """Decorator for running the annotated function as a SageMaker training job.

    This decorator wraps the annotated code and runs it as a new SageMaker job synchronously
    with the provided runtime settings.

    If a parameter value is not set, the decorator first looks up the value from the SageMaker
    configuration file. If no value is specified in the configuration file or no configuration file
    is found, the decorator selects the default as specified below. For more information, see
    `Configuring and using defaults with the SageMaker Python SDK <https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/
    en/stable/overview.html#configuring-and-using-defaults-with-the-sagemaker-python-sdk>`_.

    Args:
        _func (Optional): A Python function to run as a SageMaker training job.

        dependencies (str): Either the path to a dependencies file or the reserved keyword
          ``auto_capture``. Defaults to ``None``.
          If ``dependencies`` is provided, the value must be one of the following:

          * A path to a conda environment.yml file. The following conditions apply.

            * If job_conda_env is set, then the conda environment is updated by installing
              dependencies from the yaml file and the function is invoked within that
              conda environment. For this to succeed, the specified conda environment must
              already exist in the image.
            * If the environment variable ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` is set in the image, then the
              conda environment is updated by installing dependencies from the yaml file and the
              function is invoked within that conda environment. For this to succeed, the
              conda environment name must already be set in ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV``, and
              ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` must already exist in the image.
            * If none of the previous conditions are met, a new conda environment named
              ``sagemaker-runtime-env`` is created and the function annotated with the remote
              decorator is invoked in that conda environment.

          * A path to a requirements.txt file. The following conditions apply.

            * If ``job_conda_env`` is set in the remote decorator, dependencies are installed
              within that conda environment and the function annotated with the remote decorator
              is invoked in the same conda environment. For this to succeed, the specified
              conda environment must already exist in the image.
            * If an environment variable ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` is set in the image,
              dependencies are installed within that conda environment and the function annotated
              with the remote decorator is invoked in the same. For this to succeed, the conda
              environment name must already be set in ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV``, and
              ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` must already exist in the image.
            * If none of the above conditions are met, conda is not used. Dependencies are
              installed at the system level, without any virtual environment, and the function
              annotated with the remote decorator is invoked using the Python runtime available
              in the system path.

          * The parameter dependencies is set to ``auto_capture``. SageMaker will automatically
            generate an env_snapshot.yml corresponding to the current active conda environmentâ€™s
            snapshot. You do not need to provide a dependencies file. The following conditions
            apply:

            * You must run the remote function within an active conda environment.
            * When installing the dependencies on the training job, the same conditions as when
              dependencies is set to a path to a conda environment file apply. These conditions are
              as follows:

              * If job_conda_env is set, then the conda environment is updated by installing
                dependencies from the yaml file and the function is invoked within that
                conda environment. For this to succeed, the specified conda environment must
                already exist in the image.
              * If the environment variable ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` is set in the image, then
                the conda environment is updated by installing dependencies from the yaml file
                and the function is invoked within that conda environment. For this to
                succeed, the conda environment name must already be set in
                ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV``, and ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` must already exist
                in the image.
              * If none of the previous conditions are met, a new conda environment with name
                ``sagemaker-runtime-env`` is created and the function annotated with the
                remote decorator is invoked in that conda environment.

          * ``None``. SageMaker will assume that there are no dependencies to install while
            executing the remote annotated function in the training job.

        pre_execution_commands (List[str]): List of commands to be executed prior to executing
          remote function. Only one of ``pre_execution_commands`` or ``pre_execution_script``
          can be specified at the same time. Defaults to None.

        pre_execution_script (str): Path to script file to be executed prior to executing
          remote function. Only one of ``pre_execution_commands`` or ``pre_execution_script``
          can be specified at the same time. Defaults to None.

        environment_variables (Dict): The environment variables used inside the decorator function.
          Defaults to ``None``.

        image_uri (str): The universal resource identifier (URI) location of a Docker image on
          Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Defaults to the following based on where the SDK
          is running:

            * For users who specify ``spark_config`` and want to run the function in a Spark
              application, the ``image_uri`` should be ``None``. A SageMaker Spark image will
              be used for training, otherwise a ``ValueError`` is thrown.
            * For users on SageMaker Studio notebooks, the image used as the kernel image for the
              notebook is used.
            * For other users, it is resolved to base python image with the same python version
              as the environment running the local code.

          If no compatible image is found, a ValueError is thrown.

        include_local_workdir (bool): A flag to indicate that the remote function should include
          local directories. Set to ``True`` if the remote function code imports local modules and
          methods that are not available via PyPI or conda. Default value is ``False``.

        instance_count (int): The number of instances to use. Defaults to 1.
          NOTE: Remote function does not support instance_count > 1 for non Spark jobs.

        instance_type (str): The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance type to use to run
          the SageMaker job. e.g. ml.c4.xlarge. If not provided, a ValueError is thrown.

        job_conda_env (str): The name of the conda environment to activate during job's runtime.
          Defaults to ``None``.

        job_name_prefix (str): The prefix used used to create the underlying SageMaker job.

        keep_alive_period_in_seconds (int): The duration in seconds to retain and reuse provisioned
          infrastructure after the completion of a training job, also known as SageMaker managed
          warm pools. The use of warmpools reduces the latency time spent to provision new
          resources. The default value for ``keep_alive_period_in_seconds`` is 0.
          NOTE: Additional charges associated with warm pools may apply. Using this parameter also
          activates a new persistent cache feature, which will further reduce job start up
          latency than over using SageMaker managed warm pools alone by caching the package source
          downloaded in the previous runs.

        max_retry_attempts (int): The max number of times the job is retried on
          ``InternalServerFailure`` Error from SageMaker service. Defaults to 1.

        max_runtime_in_seconds (int): The upper limit in seconds to be used for training. After
          this specified amount of time, SageMaker terminates the job regardless of its current
          status. Defaults to 1 day or (86400 seconds).

        role (str): The IAM role (either name or full ARN) used to run your SageMaker training
          job. Defaults to:

          * the SageMaker default IAM role if the SDK is running in SageMaker Notebooks or
            SageMaker Studio Notebooks.
          * if not above, a ValueError is be thrown.

        s3_kms_key (str): The key used to encrypt the input and output data. Default to ``None``.

        s3_root_uri (str): The root S3 folder to which the code archives and data are
          uploaded to. Defaults to ``s3://<sagemaker-default-bucket>``.

        sagemaker_session (sagemaker.session.Session): The underlying SageMaker session to which
          SageMaker service calls are delegated to (default: None). If not provided, one is created
          using a default configuration chain.

        security_group_ids (List[str): A list of security group IDs. Defaults to ``None`` and the
          training job is created without VPC config.

        subnets (List[str): A list of subnet IDs. Defaults to ``None`` and the job is created
          without VPC config.

        tags (List[Tuple[str, str]): A list of tags attached to the job. Defaults to ``None`` and
          the training job is created without tags.

        volume_kms_key (str): An Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) key used to encrypt an
          Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume attached to the training instance. Defaults to
          ``None``.

        volume_size (int): The size in GB of the storage volume for storing input and output data
          during training. Defaults to ``30``.

        encrypt_inter_container_traffic (bool): A flag that specifies whether traffic between
          training containers is encrypted for the training job. Defaults to ``False``.

        spark_config (SparkConfig): Configurations to the Spark application that runs on
          Spark image. If ``spark_config`` is specified, a SageMaker Spark image uri
          will be used for training. Note that ``image_uri`` can not be specified at the
          same time otherwise a ``ValueError`` is thrown. Defaults to ``None``.

        use_spot_instances (bool): Specifies whether to use SageMaker Managed Spot instances for
          training. If enabled then the ``max_wait_time_in_seconds`` arg should also be set.
          Defaults to ``False``.

        max_wait_time_in_seconds (int): Timeout in seconds waiting for spot training job.
          After this amount of time Amazon SageMaker will stop waiting for managed spot training
          job to complete. Defaults to ``None``.

        """Constructor for RemoteExecutor

        If a parameter value is not set, the constructor first looks up the value from the
        SageMaker configuration file. If no value is specified in the configuration file or
        no configuration file is found, the constructor selects the default as specified below.
        For more information, see `Configuring and using defaults with the SageMaker Python SDK
        <https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html
        #configuring-and-using-defaults-with-the-sagemaker-python-sdk>`_.

        Args:
            _func (Optional): A Python function to run as a SageMaker training job.

            dependencies (str): Either the path to a dependencies file or the reserved keyword
              ``auto_capture``. Defaults to ``None``.
              If ``dependencies`` is provided, the value must be one of the following:

            * A path to a conda environment.yml file. The following conditions apply.

              * If job_conda_env is set, then the conda environment is updated by installing
                dependencies from the yaml file and the function is invoked within that
                conda environment. For this to succeed, the specified conda environment must
                already exist in the image.
              * If the environment variable ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` is set in the image, then
                the conda environment is updated by installing dependencies from the yaml file and
                the function is invoked within that conda environment. For this to succeed, the
                conda environment name must already be set in ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV``, and
                ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` must already exist in the image.
              * If none of the previous conditions are met, a new conda environment named
                ``sagemaker-runtime-env`` is created and the function annotated with the remote
                decorator is invoked in that conda environment.

            * A path to a requirements.txt file. The following conditions apply.

              * If ``job_conda_env`` is set in the remote decorator, dependencies are installed
                within that conda environment and the function annotated with the remote decorator
                is invoked in the same conda environment. For this to succeed, the specified
                conda environment must already exist in the image.
              * If an environment variable ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` is set in the image,
                dependencies are installed within that conda environment and the function annotated
                with the remote decorator is invoked in the same. For this to succeed, the
                conda environment name must already be set in ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV``, and
                ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` must already exist in the image.
              * If none of the above conditions are met, conda is not used. Dependencies are
                installed at the system level, without any virtual environment, and the function
                annotated with the remote decorator is invoked using the Python runtime available
                in the system path.

            * The parameter dependencies is set to ``auto_capture``. SageMaker will automatically
                generate an env_snapshot.yml corresponding to the current active conda environmentâ€™s
                snapshot. You do not need to provide a dependencies file. The following conditions
                apply:

              * You must run the remote function within an active conda environment.
              * When installing the dependencies on the training job, the same conditions as when
                dependencies is set to a path to a conda environment file apply. These conditions
                are as follows:

                  * If job_conda_env is set, then the conda environment is updated by installing
                    dependencies from the yaml file and the function is invoked within that
                    conda environment. For this to succeed, the specified conda environment must
                    already exist in the image.
                  * If the environment variable ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` is set in the image,
                    then the conda environment is updated by installing dependencies from the yaml
                    file and the function is invoked within that conda environment. For this to
                    succeed, the conda environment name must already be set in
                    ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV``, and ``SAGEMAKER_JOB_CONDA_ENV`` must already exist
                    in the image.
                  * If none of the previous conditions are met, a new conda environment with name
                    ``sagemaker-runtime-env`` is created and the function annotated with the
                    remote decorator is invoked in that conda environment.

              * ``None``. SageMaker will assume that there are no dependencies to install while
                executing the remote annotated function in the training job.

            pre_execution_commands (List[str]): List of commands to be executed prior to executing
              remote function. Only one of ``pre_execution_commands`` or ``pre_execution_script``
              can be specified at the same time. Defaults to None.

            pre_execution_script (str): Path to script file to be executed prior to executing
              remote function. Only one of ``pre_execution_commands`` or ``pre_execution_script``
              can be specified at the same time. Defaults to None.

            environment_variables (Dict): The environment variables used inside the decorator
              function. Defaults to ``None``.

            image_uri (str): The universal resource identifier (URI) location of a Docker image on
              Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Defaults to the following based on where the
              SDK is running:

              * For users who specify ``spark_config`` and want to run the function in a Spark
                application, the ``image_uri`` should be ``None``. A SageMaker Spark image will
                be used for training, otherwise a ``ValueError`` is thrown.
              * For users on SageMaker Studio notebooks, the image used as the kernel image for
                the notebook is used.
              * For other users, it is resolved to base python image with the same python
                version as the environment running the local code.

              If no compatible image is found, a ValueError is thrown.

            include_local_workdir (bool): A flag to indicate that the remote function should include
              local directories. Set to ``True`` if the remote function code imports local modules
              and methods that are not available via PyPI or conda. Default value is ``False``.

            instance_count (int): The number of instances to use. Defaults to 1.
              NOTE: Remote function does not support instance_count > 1 for non Spark jobs.

            instance_type (str): The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance type to use to run
              the SageMaker job. e.g. ml.c4.xlarge. If not provided, a ValueError is thrown.

            job_conda_env (str): The name of the conda environment to activate during job's runtime.
              Defaults to ``None``.

            job_name_prefix (str): The prefix used used to create the underlying SageMaker job.

            keep_alive_period_in_seconds (int): The duration in seconds to retain and reuse
              provisioned infrastructure after the completion of a training job, also known as
              SageMaker managed warm pools. The use of warmpools reduces the latency time spent to
              provision new resources. The default value for ``keep_alive_period_in_seconds`` is 0.
              NOTE: Additional charges associated with warm pools may apply. Using this parameter
              also activates a new pesistent cache feature, which will further reduce job start
              up latency than over using SageMaker managed warm pools alone by caching the package
              source downloaded in the previous runs.

            max_parallel_jobs (int): Maximum number of jobs that run in parallel. Defaults to 1.

            max_retry_attempts (int): The max number of times the job is retried on
              ``InternalServerFailure`` Error from SageMaker service. Defaults to 1.

            max_runtime_in_seconds (int): The upper limit in seconds to be used for training. After
              this specified amount of time, SageMaker terminates the job regardless of its current
              status. Defaults to 1 day or (86400 seconds).

            role (str): The IAM role (either name or full ARN) used to run your SageMaker training
              job. Defaults to:

              * the SageMaker default IAM role if the SDK is running in SageMaker Notebooks or
                SageMaker Studio Notebooks.
              * if not above, a ValueError is be thrown.

            s3_kms_key (str): The key used to encrypt the input and output data.
              Default to ``None``.

            s3_root_uri (str): The root S3 folder to which the code archives and data are
              uploaded to. Defaults to ``s3://<sagemaker-default-bucket>``.

            sagemaker_session (sagemaker.session.Session): The underlying SageMaker session to which
              SageMaker service calls are delegated to (default: None). If not provided, one is
              created using a default configuration chain.

            security_group_ids (List[str): A list of security group IDs. Defaults to ``None`` and
              the training job is created without VPC config.

            subnets (List[str): A list of subnet IDs. Defaults to ``None`` and the job is
              created without VPC config.

            tags (List[Tuple[str, str]): A list of tags attached to the job. Defaults to ``None``
              and the training job is created without tags.

            volume_kms_key (str): An Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) key used to encrypt an
              Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume attached to the training instance.
              Defaults to ``None``.

            volume_size (int): The size in GB of the storage volume for storing input and output
              data during training. Defaults to ``30``.

            encrypt_inter_container_traffic (bool): A flag that specifies whether traffic between
              training containers is encrypted for the training job. Defaults to ``False``.

            enable_network_isolation (bool): A flag that specifies whether container will run in
              network isolation mode. Defaults to ``False``. Network isolation mode restricts the
              container access to outside networks (such as the Internet). The container does not
              make any inbound or outbound network calls. Also known as Internet-free mode.

            spark_config (SparkConfig): Configurations to the Spark application that runs on
              Spark image. If ``spark_config`` is specified, a SageMaker Spark image uri
              will be used for training. Note that ``image_uri`` can not be specified at the
              same time otherwise a ``ValueError`` is thrown. Defaults to ``None``.

            use_spot_instances (bool): Specifies whether to use SageMaker Managed Spot instances for
              training. If enabled then the ``max_wait_time_in_seconds`` arg should also be set.
              Defaults to ``False``.

            max_wait_time_in_seconds (int): Timeout in seconds waiting for spot training job.
              After this amount of time Amazon SageMaker will stop waiting for managed spot training
              job to complete. Defaults to ``None``.

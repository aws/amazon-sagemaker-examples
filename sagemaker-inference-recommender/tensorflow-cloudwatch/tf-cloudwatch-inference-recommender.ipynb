    "SageMaker Inference Recommender is a new capability of SageMaker that reduces the time required to get machine learning (ML) models in production by automating load tests and optimizing model performance across instance types. You can use Inference Recommender to select a real-time inference endpoint that delivers the best performance at the lowest cost. \n",

Upload the current notebook and set the kernel. You can also run this in SageMaker Studio Notebooks with the `TensorFlow 2.1 Python 3.6 CPU Optimized` kernel.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook discussed how to use SageMaker Inference Recommender with a TensorFlow model to help determine the right CPU instance type, instance count and environment variables to reduce costs and maximize performance. The notebook walked you through downloading a pre-trained TensorFlow model, registering your model in Model Registry, creating an Inference Recommender Default job, and creating an Inference Recommender Advanced job to get recommendations. In addition, you can use the supplied helper functions to review CloudWatch metrics right from your notebook. You can modify the environment variables and instance types to match your own ML workload as well as bring your own TensorFlow model for testing."

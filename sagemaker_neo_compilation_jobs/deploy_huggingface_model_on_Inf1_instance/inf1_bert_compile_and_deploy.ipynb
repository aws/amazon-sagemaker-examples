    "AWS Inferentia is Amazon's first custom silicon designed to accelerate deep learning workloads and is part of a long-term strategy to deliver on this vision. AWS Inferentia is designed to provide high performance inference in the cloud, to drive down the total cost of inference, and to make it easy for developers to integrate machine learning into their business applications. AWS Inferentia chips deliver up 2.3x higher throughput and up to 70% lower cost per inference than comparable current generation GPU-based Amazon EC2 instances, as we will confirm in the example notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "[AWS Neuron](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) is a software development kit (SDK) for running machine learning inference using AWS Inferentia chips. It consists of a compiler, run-time, and profiling tools that enable developers to run high-performance and low latency inference using AWS Inferentia-based Amazon EC2 Inf1 instances. Using Neuron, you can bring your models that have been trained on any popular framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet), and run them optimally on Inferentia. There is excellent support for Vision and NLP models especially, and on top of that we have released great features to help you make the most efficient use of the hardware, such as [dynamic batching](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/neuron-guide/appnotes/perf/torch-neuron-dataparallel-app-note.html#dynamic-batching-description) or [Data Parallel](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/neuron-guide/neuron-frameworks/pytorch-neuron/api-torch-neuron-dataparallel-api.html) inferencing.\n",

This includes CPU and GPU-based instances, but also Inf1 instances; in this case, SageMaker Neo uses the Neuron SDK to compile your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example notebook, we will deploy 2 HuggingFace NLP models for the task of paraphrase classification on SageMaker endpoints. One will be deployed on a GPU-accelerated instance, with no changes to the model; the other will be compiled and deployed to an Inf1 instance on SageMaker. Finally, we will perform a simple benchmark to compare the performance of both endpoints in terms of latency and throughput. "

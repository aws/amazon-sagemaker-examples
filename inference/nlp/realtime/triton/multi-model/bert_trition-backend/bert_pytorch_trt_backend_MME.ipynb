Previously, customers had limited options to deploy 100s of deep learning models that need accelerated compute with GPUs. Now customers can deploy 1000s of deep learning models behind one SageMaker endpoint. MME can run multiple models on a GPU core, share GPU instances behind an endpoint across multiple models and dynamically load/unload models based on the incoming traffic. With this, customers can significantly save cost and achieve best price performance.\n",

    "1. SageMaker routes traffic to the right instance behind the endpoint where the target model is loaded. SageMaker takes care of model management behind the endpoint, loads model to the container's memory and unloads the model based on the endpoint's traffic pattern.\n",
    "2. Dynamically loads models from Amazon Simple Storage Service(S3) to the instance’s storage volume. If the invoked models are not available on instance storage volume, the model is downloaded onto instance storage volume. If the instance storage volume reaches capacity, SageMaker deletes any unused models from the storage volume.\n",
    "3. SageMaker loads the model to NVIDIA Triton container’s memory on GPU accelerated instance and serve the inference request. If the model is already loaded in the container memory, the subsequent requests are served faster as SageMaker does not need to download and load it again.\n",
    "4. SageMaker takes care of traffic shaping to the MME endpoint, SageMaker continues to route traffics to the instance where the model is loaded. If the instance resources reach capacity due to high utilization, SageMaker unloads the least used models from the container to free up resource to load more frequently used models.\n",
    "5. SageMaker MME can horizontally scale using auto-scaling policy, provision additional GPU compute instances based on metrics such as GPU utilization, memory utilization etc. to serve spiky traffic to MME endpoints."

    "## Introduction to NVIDIA Triton Server\n",
    "\n",
    "[NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/) was developed specifically to enable scalable, cost-effective, and easy deployment of models in production. NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is open-source inference serving software that simplifies the inference serving process and provides high inference performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key features of Triton are:\n",
    "* **Support for Multiple frameworks**: Triton can be used to deploy models from all major frameworks. Triton supports TensorFlow GraphDef, TensorFlow SavedModel, ONNX, PyTorch TorchScript, TensorRT, RAPIDS FIL for tree based models, and OpenVINO model formats. \n",
    "* **Model pipelines**: Triton model ensemble represents a pipeline of one or more models or pre/post-processing logic and the connection of input and output tensors between them. A single inference request to an ensemble will trigger the execution of the entire pipeline.\n",
    "* **Concurrent model execution**: Multiple models (or multiple instances of the same model) can run simultaneously on the same GPU or on multiple GPUs for different model management needs.\n",
    "* **Dynamic batching**: For models that support batching, Triton has multiple built-in scheduling and batching algorithms that combine individual inference requests together to improve inference throughput. These scheduling and batching decisions are transparent to the client requesting inference.\n",
    "* **Diverse CPUs and GPUs**: The models can be executed on CPUs or GPUs for maximum flexibility and to support heterogeneous computing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This initial release of NVIDIA Triton on SageMaker will only support a single model. Future releases will have multi-model support. A minimal `config.pbtxt` configuration file is **required** in the model artifacts. This release doesn't support inferring the model config automatically."

    "\n",
    "Amazon Elastic Inference (EI) is a resource you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instances to accelerate your deep learning (DL) inference workloads. EI allows you to add inference acceleration to an Amazon SageMaker hosted endpoint or Jupyter notebook and reduce the cost of running deep learning inference by up to 75%, when compared to using GPU instances. For more information, please visit: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ei.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon EI provides support for a variety of frameworks, including Apache MXNet and ONNX models. The [Open Neural Network Exchange](https://onnx.ai/) (ONNX) is an open standard format for deep learning models that enables interoperability between deep learning frameworks such as Apache MXNet, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), PyTorch and more. This means that we can use any of these frameworks to train the model, export these pretrained models in ONNX format and then import them in MXNet for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use the ResNet-152v1 model from [Deep residual learning for image recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). This model, alongside many others, can be found at the [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models).\n",

If an EI accelerator is attached to your endpoint and a custom `model_fn` isn't provided, then the default `model_fn` loads the MXNet Module object with an EI context, `mx.eia()`. This default `model_fn` works with the default save function provided by the pre-built SageMaker MXNet Docker image for training. If the model is saved in a different manner, then a custom `model_fn` implementation may be needed. For more information on `model_fn`, see [the SageMaker documentation](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html#load-a-model).\n",

With other models, you may want to experiment with other instance types and accelerators based on your model requirements."

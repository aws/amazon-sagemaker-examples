    "MNIST is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). This tutorial will show how to train and test an MNIST model on SageMaker using PyTorch.\n",

    "### Add a policy to your SageMaker role in IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are running this notebook on an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance**, the IAM role assumed by your notebook instance needs permission to create and run workflows in AWS Step Functions. To provide this permission to the role, do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Amazon [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). \n",
    "2. Select **Notebook instances** and choose the name of your notebook instance\n",
    "3. Under **Permissions and encryption** select the role ARN to view the role on the IAM console\n",
    "4. Choose **Attach policies** and search for `AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess`.\n",
    "5. Select the check box next to `AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess` and choose **Attach policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running this notebook in a local environment, the SDK will use your configured AWS CLI configuration. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).\n",

    "2. Select **Roles** and then **Create role**.\n",
    "3. Under **Choose the service that will use this role** select **Step Functions**\n",
    "4. Choose **Next** until you can enter a **Role name**\n",

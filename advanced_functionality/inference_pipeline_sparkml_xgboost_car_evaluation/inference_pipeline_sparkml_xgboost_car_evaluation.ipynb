    "# Deploy Apache Spark pre-processing and post-processing with XGBoost for real-time prediction requests in Amazon SageMaker using Inference Pipelines\n",
    " \n",
    "You deploy Inference Pipelines in Amazon SageMaker to execute a sequence of pre-processing, inference, and post-processing steps on real-time and batch inference requests. This makes it easy to build and deploy feature preprocessing pipelines with a suite of feature transformers available in the new SparkML and scikit-learn containers in Amazon SageMaker. You can write your data processing code once and reuse it for training and inference which provides consistency in your machine learning workflows and easier management of your models. You can deploy upto five steps in your inference pipeline and they all execute on the same instance so there is minimal latency impact. The same inference pipeline can be used for real-time and batch inferences.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this example, we’ll use the [Car Evaluation Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation) from [UCI’s Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). Our goal is to predict the acceptability of a specific car, amongst the values of: `unacc`, `acc`, `good`, and `vgood`. At the core, it is a classification problem and we will train a machine learning model using Amazon SageMaker’s built-in XGBoost algorithm. However, the dataset only contains six categorical string features - `buying`, `maint`, `doors`, `persons`, `lug_boot`, and `safety` and XGBoost can only process data that is in numerical format. Therefore we will pre-process the input data using [SparkML](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.2/ml-guide.html) [StringIndexer](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#stringindexer) followed by [OneHotEncoder](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#onehotencoderestimator) to convert it to numerical format. We will also apply a post-processing step on the prediction result using SparkML [IndexToString](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#indextostring) to convert our inference output back to their original labels that correspond to the predicted condition of the car.\n",
    " \n",
    "We’ll write our SparkML pre-processing and post-processing scripts once, and apply them for processing training data using AWS Glue. Then, we will serialize and capture the SparkML artifacts produced by AWS Glue to Amazon S3 using [MLeap](http://mleap-docs.combust.ml/). This is so that they can be reused during inference for real-time requests using the SparkML Serving container that Amazon SageMaker provides. Finally, we will deploy the pre-processing, inference, and post-processing steps in an inference pipeline and will execute these steps in order for each real-time inference request.\n"

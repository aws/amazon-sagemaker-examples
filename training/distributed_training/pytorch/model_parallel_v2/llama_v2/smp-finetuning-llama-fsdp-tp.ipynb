    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "You need to create an S3 bucket to store the input data for training. This bucket must be located in the same AWS Region that you choose to launch your training job. To learn how to create a S3 bucket, see (Create your first S3 bucket in the Amazon S3 documentation)[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html].\n",

    "1. Create a new SageMaker notebook instance and open it.\n",
    "2. Zip the contents of this folder & upload to the instance with the Upload button on the top-right.\n",
    "3. Open a new terminal with `New -> Terminal`.\n",

    "    1. `cd SageMaker && unzip <your-zip-name-here>.zip`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locally\n",
    "You can run locally by launching a Jupyter notebook server with `jupyter notebook`. This requires you to set your aws credentials in the environment manually. See [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) for more details."

    "### Set hyperparameters, metric definitions, and MPI options\n",
    "#### Tensor Parallelism\n",
    "Tensor parallelism is a type of model parallelism in which specific model weights, gradients, and/ or optimizer states are split across devices, by replacing specific submodules in the model with their distributed implementations. The tensor parallel degree controls the sharding level and can be set from 1 to `world_size`, though we only recommend setting 1 to 8, assuming an 8-gpu node such as ml.p4d.24xlarge. This is because inter-node tensor parallel communication is much slower than intra-node tensor parallel communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see [tensor parallelism](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-tensor-parallelism.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hybrid Sharding\n",
    "Hybrid sharding is a memory saving technique in between `FULL_SHARD` and `NO_SHARD` with `FULL_SHARD` saving the most and `NO_SHARD` not saving any. This technique shards parameters within the hybrid shard degree (HSD) group and replicates parameters across groups. The hybrid shard degree (HSD) controls sharding across GPUs and can be set to an integer from 0 to `world_size`.\n",
    "- An HSD of 8 applies `FULL_SHARD` within a node and then replicates parameters across nodes since there are 8 GPUs in the nodes we are using. This results in reduced communication volume as expensive all-gathers and reduce-scatters are only done within a node, which can be more performant for medium-sized models.\n",
    "Generally, you want to use the smallest HSD that does not cause Out of Memory (OOM) errors. If you are hitting OOM, try increasing the hybrid shard degree to reduce memory usage on each node.\n",
    "- An HSD of 0 falls back to the native PyTorch implementation and API in the script. If `FULL_SHARD` was the strategy set, it would shard across the whole cluster of GPUs. If `HYBRID_SHARD` or `_HYBRID_SHARD_ZERO2` was the strategy, the default is equivalent to an HSD of 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see [fsdp.ShardingStrategy](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html#torch.distributed.fsdp).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation Offloading\n",
    "Activation offloading is a memory saving technique which requires activation checkpointing to be enabled. Enabling this offloads activations onto CPU memory to save GPU memory. This is useful when our model is too large to fit in our nodes or when we want to train with a larger batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### SageMaker Activation Offloading\n",
    "SageMaker activation offloading improves performance by pre-fetching activations from the CPU before they are needed, so that the GPU does not wait for the activations to be loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `\"sm_activation_offloading\": True` enables our improved version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we generally only need activation offloading for models >= 20B parameters or if we are getting OOM with a given batch size. We use it here simply to illustrate how to enable it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Activation Loading Horizon\n",
    "The activation loading horizon is the maximum number of loaded tensors that can be in the GPU memory simultaneously. This has to be greater than or equal to 1, and defaults to 2."

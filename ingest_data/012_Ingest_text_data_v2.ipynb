    "# Ingest Text Data\n",
    "Labeled text data can be in a structured data format, such as reviews for sentiment analysis, news headlines for topic modeling, or documents for text classification. In these cases, you may have one column for the label, one column for the text, and sometimes other columns for attributes. You can treat this structured data like tabular data, and ingest it in one of the ways discussed in the previous notebook [011_Ingest_tabular_data.ipynb](011_Ingest_tabular_data_v1.ipynb). Sometimes text data, especially raw text data comes as unstructured data and is often in .json or .txt format, and we will discuss how to ingest these types of data files into a SageMaker Notebook in this section.\n"

These packages, such as `Pandas`, have implemented options to access data with a specified path string: while you will use `file://` on your local file system, you will use `s3://` instead to access the data through the AWS boto library. For `pandas`, any valid string path is acceptable. The string could be a URL. Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, and file. For file URLs, a host is expected. You can find additional documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html). \n",

    "Welcome to [SageMaker JumpStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html)! SageMaker JumpStart is the Machine Learning (ML) Hub of SageMaker that offers 350+ pre-trained models, built-in algorithms, and pre-built solution templates to help customers get started with ML quickly. You can access these models and algorithms in JumpStart programmatically using [SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-built-in-algorithms-with-pre-trained-models-in-sagemaker-python-sdk) or through the JumpStart UI in [SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html). In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use Amazon’s state-of-the-art [Alexa Teacher Model 20 Billion parameter model](https://www.amazon.science/blog/20b-parameter-alexa-model-sets-new-marks-in-few-shot-learning) (AlexaTM 20B), through the [SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-prebuilt-models-with-sagemaker-jumpstart).\n",

    "AlexaTM 20B is a multitask, multilingual, large-scale sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, trained on a mixture of Common Crawl (mC4) and Wikipedia data across 12 languages, using denoising and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on common in-context language tasks such as 1-shot summarization and 1-shot machine translation, outperforming decoder only models such as Open AI’s GPT3 and Google’s PaLM, that are over eight times bigger.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In-context learning - also known as \"prompting\" - refers to a method where you use a NLP model on a new task without having to fine-tune it. A few task examples are provided to the model only as part of the inference input, a paradigm known as \"few-shot in-context learning\". In some cases, the model can perform well without any training data at all, only given an explanation of what should be predicted. This is called \"zero-shot in-context learning\".  A simple example of the latter is passing as input to a multilingual generation model the following sentence: \"Translate from English to French. Original: We should hurry up and get out of there; Translation: \". The model completes the example, prompted to translate the original text due to the setup we provided. To learn more about the model, please check out the Amazon Science [blog post](https://www.amazon.science/blog/20b-parameter-alexa-model-sets-new-marks-in-few-shot-learning) or read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01448). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to deploy the AlexaTM 20B through the JumpStart API and run inference. Furthermore, we demonstrate how AlexaTM 20B can be used for in-context learning with five example tasks: (i) Text Summarization, (ii) Natural Language generation, (iii) Machine Translation, (iv) Extractive Question Answering, and (v) Natural language Inference and Classification.\n",

    "JumpStart allows you to deploy pre-trained models for inference without having to fine-tune them on a new dataset. This can be done by first fetching `deploy_image_uri` - an optimized deep learning container image - using the `model_id`. SageMaker gives customers the ability to run docker containers extensively for training and inferencing. JumpStart uses these available framework-specific SageMaker Deep Learning Containers (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html) (DLCs). Then, we fetch the `model_uri` containing the model parameters, along with inference handling scripts and any associated dependencies. Finally, we go on to create a [sagemaker.model.Model](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/inference/model.html) instance in SageMaker and deploy it to a real-time endpoint.\n",

We append a test input to the prompt and allow the language model to make predictions by conditioning on the prompt and predicting the next tokens/words. It is a highly effective technique to solve few-shot learning problems, a setting where we learn a task from a few training samples. Unlike prior sequence-to-sequence models, AlexaTM 20B was trained on causal language modeling in addition to denoising, which makes it a model very performant for in-context learning.

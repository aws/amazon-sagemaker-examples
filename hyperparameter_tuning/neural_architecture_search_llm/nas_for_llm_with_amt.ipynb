    "# Neural Architecture Search for Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an effective framework to design neural network architectures automatically.\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to utilize NAS for compressing a large language model that has been fine-tuned for a specific target task. The main objective is to reduce the model size while maintaining performance as much as possible. To achieve this, we search for sub-networks within the model that jointly optimize the parameter count and validation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-networks can be defined in various ways. In this context, we consider subsets of multi-head attention and fully-connected layers, with a reduced number of heads in the multi-head attention layer and units in the intermediate layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our NAS approach consists of two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial fine-tuning of the pre-trained model on the target task using weight-sharing based NAS training strategies. The pre-trained model serves as a 'super-network' that encompasses a large, finite set of sub-networks. To prevent sub-networks from co-adapting, we modify the fine-tuning process by updating only specific parts of the network (i.e., subsets of all layers) in each update step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the second step, we employ multi-objective search through [SageMaker Automated Model Tuning (AMT)](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/automatic-model-tuning/) to identify a set of sub-networks that offer an optimal trade-off between parameter count and validation error for the target task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can visualize the so-called **Pareto set** of architectures that optimally balance between parameter count and validation error, and select the best-suited model that strikes the right balance between model size and validation error for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Currently, the notebook limited to the BERT model family.\n",
    "- We exclusively focus on supervised fine-tuning using labeled datasets."

    "After the fine-tuning process, we begin the multi-objective search by sampling random sub-networks using AMT. A sub-network is defined by its number of layers, heads, and units in the intermediate fully connected layers. To access a sub-network, we place a binary mask over the super-network and mask out all components (i.e., heads, units) that are not part of the sub-network. Note that, HuggingFace transformers needs the hidden size to be a multiple of the number of head. We cannot change the hidden size, and hence the number of heads has to be in [1, 3, 6, 12].\n",

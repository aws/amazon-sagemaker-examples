However, when implemented on top of Simultaneous Multi Threading (SMT) such Intel’s HypeThreading, a certain process might oversubscribe a particular core by spawning twice the threads as the number of actual CPU cores. In certain cases, a Python binary might end up spawning up to four times the threads as available actual processor cores. Therefore, an ideal setting for this parameter, if you have oversubscribed available cores using worker threads, is 1 or half the number of CPU cores on a SMT-enabled CPU."

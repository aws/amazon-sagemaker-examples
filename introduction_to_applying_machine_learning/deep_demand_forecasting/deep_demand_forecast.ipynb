The training data contains 321 time series from from **2012-01-01 00:00:00** to **2014-05-26 19:00:00**, and the test data contains the same time series from **2012-01-01 00:00:00** to **2014-06-02 19:00:00** (7 more days of hourly data compared to the training data). \n",

    "The [Amazon SageMaker DeepAR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html) forecasting algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm for forecasting scalar (one-dimensional) time series using recurrent neural networks (RNN). Classical forecasting methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) or exponential smoothing (ETS), fit a single model to each individual time series. They then use that model to extrapolate the time series into the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications, however, you have many similar time series across a set of cross-sectional units. For example, you might have time series groupings for demand for different products, server loads, and requests for webpages. For this type of application, you can benefit from training a single model jointly over all of the time series. DeepAR takes this approach. When your dataset contains hundreds of related time series, DeepAR outperforms the standard ARIMA and ETS methods. You can also use the trained model to generate forecasts for new time series that are similar to the ones it has been trained on.\n",

    "For information on the mathematics behind DeepAR, see [DeepAR: Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110).\n",

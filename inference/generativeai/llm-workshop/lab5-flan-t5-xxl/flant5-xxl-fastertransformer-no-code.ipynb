    "In this notebook, we explore how to host a large language model on SageMaker using the latest container that packages some of the most popular open source libraries for model parallel inference like Faster Transfomers, DeepSpeed and Hugging Face Accelerate. We use DJLServing as the model serving solution in this example. DJLServing is a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by the Deep Java Library (DJL) that is programming language agnostic. To learn more about DJL and DJLServing, you can refer to our recent blog post (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-bloom-176b-and-opt-30b-on-amazon-sagemaker-with-large-model-inference-deep-learning-containers-and-deepspeed/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models have recently exploded in both size and popularity. In 2018, BERT-large entered the scene and, with its 340M parameters and novel transformer architecture, set the standard on NLP task accuracy. Within just a few years, state-of-the-art NLP model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and similarly sized open source Bloom 176B raising the bar on NLP accuracy. This increase in the number of parameters is driven by the simple and empirically-demonstrated positive relationship between model size and accuracy: more is better. With easy access from models zoos such as Hugging Face and improved accuracy in NLP tasks such as classification and text generation, practitioners are increasingly reaching for these large models. However, deploying them can be a challenge because of their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker has rolled out Deep Learning containers container which now provides users with the ability to leverage the managed serving capabilities and help to provide the un-differentiated heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we deploy the open source Flan-T5-XXL model across GPUs on a ml.g5.12xlarge instance for efficiency. The model is loaded using split layer or tensor model partitioning through [Faster Transformers](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer). You can also quantize the model weights to int8 thereby greatly reducing the memory footprint of the model from the initial FP32. See this [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration) from Hugging Face for additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "FlanT5 is available at [Huggingface Model Hub - Model Weights](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) . For optimizations the model weights can be compiled ahead of time as well by following the steps from [Compile Model](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer/blob/main/examples/pytorch/t5/utils/huggingface_t5_ckpt_convert.py)"

    "Customer: The phone is not charging properly, and the battery seems to be draining very quickly. I've tried different charging cables and power adapters, but the issue persists.\n",
    "Agent: Hmm, that's not good. Let's try some troubleshooting steps. Can you go to Settings, then Battery, and see if there are any apps that are using up a lot of battery life?\n",
    "Customer: Yes, there are some apps that are using up a lot of battery.\n",
    "Agent: Okay, try force quitting those apps by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and then swiping up on the app to close it.\n",
    "Customer: I did that, but the issue is still there.\n",
    "Agent: Alright, let's try resetting your iPhone's settings to their default values. This won't delete any of your data. Go to Settings, then General, then Reset, and then choose Reset All Settings.\n",
    "Customer: Okay, I did that. What's next?\n",
    "Agent: Now, let's try restarting your iPhone. Press and hold the power button until you see the \"slide to power off\" option. Slide to power off, wait a few seconds, and then turn your iPhone back on.\n",
    "Customer: Alright, I restarted it, but it's still not charging properly.\n",
    "Agent: I see. It looks like we need to run a diagnostic test on your iPhone. Please visit the nearest Apple Store or authorized service provider to get your iPhone checked out.\n",
    "Customer: Do I need to make an appointment?\n",
    "Agent: Yes, it's always best to make an appointment beforehand so you don't have to wait in line. You can make an appointment online or by calling the Apple Store or authorized service provider.\n",
    "Customer: Okay, will I have to pay for the repairs?\n",
    "Agent: That depends on whether your iPhone is covered under warranty or not. If it is, you won't have to pay anything. However, if it's not covered under warranty, you will have to pay for the repairs.\n",
    "Customer: How long will it take to get my iPhone back?\n",
    "Agent: It depends on the severity of the issue, but it usually takes 1-2 business days.\n",
    "Customer: Can I track the repair status online?\n",
    "Agent: Yes, you can track the repair status online or by calling the Apple Store or authorized service provider.\n",
    "Customer: Alright, thanks for your help.\n",
    "Agent: No problem, happy to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\n",
    "Customer: No, that's all for now.\n",
    "Agent: Alright, have a great day and good luck with your iPhone!\n",

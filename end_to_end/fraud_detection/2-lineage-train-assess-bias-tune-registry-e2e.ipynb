    "\n",
    "This notebook is the third part of a series of notebooks that will demonstrate how to prepare, train, and deploy a model that detects fradulent auto claims. In this notebook, we will show how you can assess pre-training and post-training bias with SageMaker Clarify, Train the Model using XGBoost on SageMaker, and then finally deposit it in the Model Registry, along with the Lineage of Artifacts that were created along the way: data, code and model metadata. You can choose to run this notebook by itself or in sequence with the other notebooks listed below. Please see the [README.md](README.md) for more information about this use case implemented by this series of notebooks. \n",

It helps you identify various types of bias in pretraining data and in posttraining that can emerge during model training or when the model is in production. SageMaker Clarify helps explain how these models make predictions using a feature attribution approach. It also monitors inferences models make in production for bias or feature attribution drift. The fairness and explainability functionality provided by SageMaker Clarify provides components that help AWS customers build less biased and more understandable machine learning models. It also provides tools to help you generate model governance reports which you can use to inform risk and compliance teams, and external regulators. \n",

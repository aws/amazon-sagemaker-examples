    "## Why SEC Filings? \n",
    "\n",
    "Financial NLP is a subset of the rapidly increasing use of ML in finance, but it is the largest; for more information, see this [survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05786). The starting point for a vast amount of financial natural language processing (NLP) is text in SEC filings. The SEC requires companies to report different types of information related to various events involving companies. To find the full list of SEC forms, see [Forms List](https://www.sec.gov/forms) in the *Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website*.\n",
    "\n",
    "SEC filings are widely used by financial services companies as a source of information about companies. Financial services companies may use this information as part of trading, lending, investment, and risk management decisions. Because these filings are required, they are of high quality. They contain forward-looking information that helps with forecasts and are written with a view to the future. In addition, in recent times, the value of historical time-series data has degraded, because economies have been structurally transformed by trade wars, pandemics, and political upheavals. Therefore, text as a source of forward-looking information has been increasing in relevance. \n",
    "\n",
    "There has been an exponential growth in downloads of SEC filings. To find out more, see [\"How to Talk When a Machine is Listening: Corporate Disclosure in the Age of AI\"]( https://www.nber.org/papers/w27950). This paper reports that the number of machine downloads of corporate 10-K and 10-Q filings increased from 360,861 in 2003 to 165,318,719 in 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a vast body of academic and practitioner research that is based on financial text, a significant portion of which is based on SEC filings. A recent review article summarizing this work is [\"Textual Analysis in Finance (2020)\"](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-financial-012820-032249). "

    "## What Does SageMaker Do? \n",
    "\n",
    "SEC filings are downloaded from the [SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) website](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search-and-access), which provides open data access. EDGAR is the primary system under the SEC for companies and others submitting documents under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and the Investment Company Act of 1940. EDGAR contains millions of company and individual filings. The system processes about 3,000 filings per day, serves up 3,000 terabytes of data to the public annually, and accommodates 40,000 new filers per year on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to download the data, and some open source packages available to extract the text from these filings. However, these require extensive programming and are not always easy to use. Following, you can find a simple *one*-API call that will create a dataset in a few lines of code, for any period of time and many tickers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This SageMaker JumpStart Industry example notebook wraps the extraction functionality into a SageMaker processing container. This notebook also provides code samples that enable users to download a dataset of filings with metadata, such as dates and parsed plain text that can then be used for machine learning using other SageMaker tools. You only need to specify a date range and a list of ticker symbols (or Central Index Key codes (CIK) codes, which are the SEC assigned identifier). This notebook does the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, this solution supports extracting a popular subset of SEC forms in plain text (excluding tables). These are 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, 497, 497K, S-3ASR and N-1A. For each of these, you can find examples following and a brief description of each form. For the 10-K and 10-Q forms, filed every year or quarter, the solution also extracts the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section, which is the primary forward-looking section in the filing. This section is the one most widely used in financial text analysis. This information is provided automatically in a separate column of the dataframe alongside the full text of the filing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted dataframe is written to Amazon S3 storage and to the local notebook instance. "

The metric calculates the number of common words between two sentences normalized by the size of the superset of the words in the two sentences. \n",

    "- One, the extractive approach retains the original sentences and thus preserves the legal meaning of the sentences. \n",
    "- Two, it works fast on very long text as we have in SEC filings. Long text is not easily handled by abstractive summarizers that are based on embeddings from transformers that can ingest a limited number of words. \n",

    "- In **Example 2**, JaccardSummarizer for the `'dataset_10k_10q_sample.csv'` data (created by data loader) runs against the `'mdna'` column. The summarizer uses the `custom_vocabulary` list set, which is the union of the customized positive and negative word lists.

    "## SEC Filing NLP Scoring  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `smjsindustry` library provides 11 NLP score types by default: `positive`, `negative`, `litigious`, `polarity`, `risk`, `readability`, `fraud`, `safe`, `certainty`, `uncertainty`, and `sentiment`. Each score (except readability and sentiment) has its word list, which is used for scanning and matching with an input text dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `readability` score type is calculated adopting the [Gunning fog index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index). \n",
    "- The `sentiment` score type adopts [VADER sentiment analysis method](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/).\n",
    "- The `polarity` score type uses the `positive` and `negative` word lists. \n",
    "- The rest of the NLP score types (`positive`, `negative`, `litigious`, `risk`, `fraud`, `safe`, `certainty`, and `uncertainty`) evaluates the similarity (word frequency) with their corresponding word lists. For example, the `positive` NLP score has its own word list that contains \"positive\" meanings. To measure the `positive` score, the NLP scorer calculates the proportion of words out of the entire texts, by counting every reading of the words that are in the word list of the `positive` score. Before matching, the words are stemmed to match different tenses of the same word. You can provide your own word list to calculate the predefined NLP scores or create your own score with a new word list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NLP score types do not use human-curated word lists such as the dictionary from [Loughran and McDonald](https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/), which is widely used in academia. Instead, the word lists are generated from word embeddings trained on standard large text corpora; each word list comprises words that are close to the concept word (such as `positive`, `negative`, and `risk` in this case) in an embedding space. These word lists may contain words that a human might list out, but might still occur in the context of the concept word.\n",
    "\n",
    "These NLP scores are added as new numerical columns to the text dataframe; this creates a multimodal dataframe, which is a mixture of tabular data and longform text, called **TabText**. When submitting this multimodal dataframe for ML, it is a good idea to normalize the columns of NLP scores (usually with standard normalization or min-max scaling).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The NLPScorer sends SageMaker processing job requests to processing containers. It might take a few minutes when spinning up a processing container. The actual filings extraction start after the initial spin-up. \n",
    "2. You are not charged for the waiting time used for the initial spin-up. \n",
    "3. You can run processing jobs in multiple instances.\n",
    "4. The name of the processing job is shown in the runtime log.\n",
    "5. You can also access the processing job from the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker). On the left navigation pane, choose Processing, Processing job.\n",
    "6. NLP scoring can be slow for massive documents such as SEC filings, which contain anywhere from 20K-100K words. Matching to word lists (usually ~200 words or more) can be time-consuming. This is why we have enabled automatic distribution of the rows of the dataframe for this task over multiple EC2 instances. In the example below, this is distributed over 4 instances and the run logs show the different instances in different colors. The user does not need to code up the distributed processing task here, it is done automatically when the number of instances is specified. \n",
    "7. VPC mode is supported in this API."

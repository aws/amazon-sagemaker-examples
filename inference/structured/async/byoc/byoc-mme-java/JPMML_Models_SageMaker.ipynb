    "# When should I build my own algorithm container?\n",
    "You may not need to create a container to bring your own code to Amazon SageMaker. When you are using a framework such as Apache MXNet or TensorFlow that has direct support in SageMaker, you can simply supply the Python code that implements your algorithm using the SDK entry points for that framework. This set of supported frameworks is regularly added to, so you should check the current list to determine whether your algorithm is written in one of these common machine learning environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if there is direct SDK support for your environment or framework, you may find it more effective to build your own container. If the code that implements your algorithm is quite complex, or you need special additions to the framework, building your own container may be the right choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some reasons to build an already supported framework container are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A specific version isn't supported.\n",
    "- Configure and install your dependencies and environment.\n",
    "- Use a different training/hosting solution than provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough shows that it is quite straightforward to build your own container. So you can still use SageMaker even if your use case is not covered by the deep learning containers that we've built for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permissions\n",
    "Running this notebook requires permissions in addition to the normal SageMakerFullAccess permissions. This is because it creates new repositories on Amazon ECR. The easiest way to add these permissions is simply to add the managed policy AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess to the role that you used to start your notebook instance. There's no need to restart your notebook instance when you do this, the new permissions will be available immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The example\n",
    "In this example we show how to package a custom Java Spring-boot container serving PMML-based Random Forest Tree model on SageMaker. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Packaging and Uploading your Algorithm for use with Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "### An overview of Docker\n",
    "If you're familiar with Docker already, you can skip ahead to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many data scientists, Docker containers are a new technology. But they are not difficult and can significantly simply the deployment of your software packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker provides a simple way to package arbitrary code into an image that is totally self-contained. Once you have an image, you can use Docker to run a container based on that image. Running a container is just like running a program on the machine except that the container creates a fully self-contained environment for the program to run. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host environment, so the way your program is set up is the way it runs, no matter where you run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is more powerful than environment managers like conda or virtualenv because (a) it is completely language independent and (b) it comprises your whole operating environment, including startup commands, and environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Docker container is like a virtual machine, but it is much lighter weight. For example, a program running in a container can start in less than a second and many containers can run simultaneously on the same physical or virtual machine instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker uses a simple file called a Dockerfile to specify how the image is assembled. An example is provided below. You can build your Docker images based on Docker images built by yourself or by others, which can simplify things quite a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker has become very popular in programming and devops communities due to its flexibility and its well-defined specification of how code can be run in its containers. It is the underpinning of many services built in the past few years, such as Amazon ECS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker uses Docker to allow users to train and deploy arbitrary algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Amazon SageMaker, Docker containers are invoked in a one way for training and another, slightly different, way for hosting. The following sections outline how to build containers for the SageMaker environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful links:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Docker home page](http://www.docker.com/)\n",
    "- [Getting started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)\n",
    "- [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)\n",
    "- [docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Amazon SageMaker runs your Docker container\n",
    "Because you can run the same image in training or hosting, Amazon SageMaker runs your container with the argument train or serve. How your container processes this argument depends on the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example, we don't define a ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile, so Docker runs the command train at training time and serve at serving time. In this example, we define these as executable Python scripts, but they could be any program that we want to start in that environment.\n",
    "- If you specify a program as a ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile, that program will be run at startup and its first argument will be train or serve. The program can then look at that argument and decide what to do.\n",
    "- If you are building separate containers for training and hosting (or building only for one or the other), you can define a program as a ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile and ignore (or verify) the first argument passed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running your container during hosting\n",
    "Hosting has a very different model than training because hosting is responding to inference requests that come in via HTTP. In this example, we use TensorFlow Serving, however the hosting solution can be customized. One example is the Python serving stack within the scikit learn example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker uses two URLs in the container:\n",
    "\n",
    "/ping receives GET requests from the infrastructure. Your program returns 200 if the container is up and accepting requests.\n",
    "/invocations is the endpoint that receives client inference POST requests. The format of the request and the response is up to the algorithm. If the client supplied ContentType and Accept headers, these are passed in as well.\n",
    "The container has the model files in the same place that they were written to during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    /opt/ml\n",
    "    `-- model\n",
    "        `-- <model files>\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dockerfile\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Dockerfile describes the image that we want to build. You can think of it as describing the complete operating system installation of the system that you want to run. A Docker container running is quite a bit lighter than a full operating system, however, because it takes advantage of Linux on the host machine for the basic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Python science stack, we start from an official TensorFlow docker image and run the normal tools to install TensorFlow Serving. Then we add the code that implements our specific algorithm to the container and set up the right environment for it to run under.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the Dockerfile for this example."

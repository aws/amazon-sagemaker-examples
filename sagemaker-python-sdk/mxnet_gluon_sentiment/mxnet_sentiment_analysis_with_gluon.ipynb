The training scripts are essentially the same as one you would write for local training, but you can also access useful properties about the training environment through various environment variables. In addition, hyperparameters are passed to the script as arguments. For more about writing an MXNet training script for use with SageMaker, see [the SageMaker documentation](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_mxnet.html#prepare-an-mxnet-training-script).\n",

The model maps each word to a vector and averages vectors of all the words in a sentence to form a hidden representation of the sentence, which is inputted to a softmax classification layer. For more details, please refer to [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759).\n",

You'll learn how to train the [EleutherAI's](https://www.eleuther.ai/) [GPT-J](https://arankomatsuzaki.wordpress.com/2021/06/04/gpt-j/) model with PyTorch 1.13 and [GLUE/SST2 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue/viewer/sst2/train) on SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "EleutherAI released GPT-J 6B, an open-source alternative to [OpenAI GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/). [GPT-J 6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) is the 6 billion parameter successor to EleutherAI's GPT-NEO family, a family of transformer-based language models based on the GPT architecture for text generation.\n",

To load it in Float32, one would need at least 2x model size CPU RAM: 1x for initial weights and another 1x to load the checkpoint. Apart from the model parameters, there are the gradients, optimizer states, and activations taking memory, so the actual memory usage might be significantly higher than 48GB. Just as an example, with Adam optimizer and FP32 training, the use from parameters, gradients and optimizer states might be 96GB+, and activation memory footprint would be even more than this, so the total memory usage might be easily larger than 200 GB.\n",

    "\n",
    "Model parallelism is the process of splitting a model up between multiple devices or nodes (such as GPU-equipped instances) and creating an efficient pipeline to train the model across these devices to maximize GPU utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing deep learning model size (layers and parameters) can result in better accuracy. However, there is a limit to the maximum model size you can fit in a single GPU. When training deep learning models, GPU memory limitations can be a bottleneck in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They can limit the size of the model you train. Given that larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, this directly translates to trained model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They can limit the batch size you train with, leading to lower GPU utilization and slower training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the limitations associated with training a model on a single GPU, you can use model parallelism to distribute and train your model on multiple computing devices.\n",

The following figure shows the simplest example of how the library splits a model with four layers to achieve two-way tensor parallelism (\"tensor_parallel_degree\": 2). The layers of each model replica are bisected and distributed into two GPUs. In this example case, the model parallel configuration also includes \"pipeline_parallel_degree\": 1 and \"ddp\": True (uses PyTorch DistributedDataParallel package in the background), so the degree of data parallelism becomes eight. The library manages communication across the tensor-distributed model replicas.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Object detection is the process of identifying and localizing objects in an image. A typical object detection solution takes an image as input and provides a bounding box on the image where an object of interest is found.  It also identifies what type of object the box encapsulates.  To create such a solution, we need to acquire and process a traning dataset, create and setup a training job for the alorithm so that it can learn about the dataset. Finally, we can then host the trained model in an endpoint, to which we can supply images.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an end-to-end example showing how the Amazon SageMaker Object Detection algorithm can be used with a publicly available dataset of bird images. We demonstrate how to train and to host an object detection model based on the [Caltech Birds (CUB 200 2011)](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) dataset.  Amazon SageMaker's object detection algorithm uses the Single Shot multibox Detector ([SSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)) algorithm, and this notebook uses a [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf) base network with that algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample results detecting a pair of goldfinch on a feeder](./goldfinch_detections.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also demonstrate how to construct a training dataset using the RecordIO format, as this is the format that the training job consumes.  This notebook is similar to the [Object Detection using the RecordIO format](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/object_detection_pascalvoc_coco/object_detection_recordio_format.ipynb) notebook, with the following key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We provide an example of how to translate bounding box specifications when providing images to SageMaker's algorithm. You will see code for generating the train.lst and val.lst files used to create [recordIO](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/architecture/note_data_loading.html) files.\n",
    "- We demonstrate how to improve an object detection model by adding training images that are flipped horizontally (mirror images).\n",
    "- We give you a notebook for experimenting with object detection challenges with an order of magnitude more classes (200 bird species, as opposed to the 20 categories used by [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/)).\n",
    "- We show how to chart the accuracy improvements that occur across the epochs of the training job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Amazon SageMaker Object Detection also allows training with the image and JSON format, which is illustrated in the [image and JSON Notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/object_detection_pascalvoc_coco/object_detection_image_json_format.ipynb)."

    "The object detection algorithm at its core is the [Single-Shot Multi-Box detection algorithm (SSD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325). This algorithm uses a `base_network`, which is typically a [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) or a [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). The Amazon SageMaker object detection algorithm supports VGG-16 and ResNet-50. It also has a number of hyperparameters that help configure the training job. The next step in our training, is to setup these hyperparameters and data channels for training the model. See the SageMaker Object Detection [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/object-detection.html) for more details on its specific hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the hyperparameters here for example is `epochs`. This defines how many passes of the dataset we iterate over and drives the training time of the algorithm. Based on our tests, we can achieve 70% accuracy on a sample mix of 5 species with 100 epochs.  When using the full 200 species, we can achieve 52% accuracy with 1,200 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Amazon SageMaker also provides [Automatic Model Tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html).  Automatic model tuning, also known as hyperparameter tuning, finds the best version of a model by running many training jobs on your dataset using the algorithm and ranges of hyperparameters that you specify. It then chooses the hyperparameter values that result in a model that performs the best, as measured by a metric that you choose.  When [tuning an Object Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/object-detection-tuning.html) algorithm for example, the tuning job could find the best `validation:mAP` score by trying out various values for certain hyperparameters such as `mini_batch_size`, `weight_decay`, and `momentum`."

The endpoint returns a JSON object that we can simply load and peek into. We have packaged the prediction code into a function to make it easier to test other images.  Note that we are defaulting the confidence threshold to 30% in our example, as a couple of the birds in our sample images were not being detected as clearly.  Defining an appropriate threshold is entirely dependent on your use case."

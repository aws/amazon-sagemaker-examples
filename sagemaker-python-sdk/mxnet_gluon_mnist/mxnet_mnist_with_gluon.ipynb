    "MNIST is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). This tutorial will show how to train and test an MNIST model on SageMaker using MXNet and the Gluon API.\n",

The training scripts are essentially the same as one you would write for local training, except that you need to provide a `train` function. The `train` function will check for the validation accuracy at the end of every epoch and checkpoints the best model so far, along with the optimizer state, in the folder `/opt/ml/checkpoints` if the folder path exists, else it will skip the checkpointing. When SageMaker calls your function, it will pass in arguments that describe the training environment. Check the script below to see how this works.\n",

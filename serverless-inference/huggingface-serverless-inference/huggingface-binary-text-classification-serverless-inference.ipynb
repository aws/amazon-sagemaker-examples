    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference is a purpose-built inference option that makes it easy for you to deploy and scale ML models. Serverless Inference is ideal for workloads which have idle periods between traffic spurts and can tolerate cold starts. Serverless endpoints automatically launch compute resources and scale them in and out depending on traffic, eliminating the need to choose instance types or manage scaling policies. This takes away the undifferentiated heavy lifting of selecting and managing servers. Serverless Inference integrates with AWS Lambda to offer you high availability, built-in fault tolerance and automatic scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serverless Inference is a great choice for customers that have intermittent or unpredictable prediction traffic. For example, a document processing service used to extract and analyze data on a periodic basis. Customers that choose Serverless Inference should make sure that their workloads can tolerate cold starts. A cold start can occur when your endpoint doesnâ€™t receive traffic for a period of time. It can also occur when your concurrent requests exceed the current request usage. The cold start time will depend on your model size, how long it takes to download, and your container startup time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a binary text classification example, which borrows from the [Hugging Face Sagemaker-sdk - Getting Started Demo code sample](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/master/sagemaker/01_getting_started_pytorch/sagemaker-notebook.ipynb)\n",

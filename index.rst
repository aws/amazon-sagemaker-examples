Welcome to Amazon SageMaker.
This site highlights example Jupyter notebooks for a variety of machine learning use cases that you can run in SageMaker.

This site is based on the `SageMaker Examples repository <https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples>`_ on GitHub.
Browse around to see what piques your interest.
To run these notebooks, you will need a SageMaker Notebook Instance or SageMaker Studio.
Refer to the SageMaker developer guide's `Get Started <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs.html>`_ page to get one of these set up.

On a Notebook Instance, the examples are pre-installed and available from the examples menu item in JupyterLab.
On SageMaker Studio, you will need to open a terminal, go to your home folder, then clone the repo with the following::

   git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples.git

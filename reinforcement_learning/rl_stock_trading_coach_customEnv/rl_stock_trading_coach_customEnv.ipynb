    "In this notebook, we apply the deep Q-network method to train an agent that will trade a single share to maximize profit. The goal is to demonstrate how to go beyond the Atari games and apply RL to a different practical domain. Based on the setup in chapter 8 of [1], we use one-minute interval historical share price series, and then apply a Double DQN architecture to accommodate a simple set of discrete trading actions: do nothing, buy a single share, and close the position. The customized environment is constructed using Open AI Gym and the RL agents are trained using Amazon SageMaker.  \n",

    "The RL problem for stock trading can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Objective*: The portfolio consists of a single stock. The goal is to teach an agent when the best time is to buy one single share and then close the position to maximize profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Environment*: Custom developed environment using Gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *State*: Single vector, which includes prices (open, high, low, close) and two numbers indicating the presence of a bought share and position profit (profit or loss we currently have from our open position). For more details, please refer to [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Action*: Do nothing: Skip the step without taking action. Buy a share: If the agent has already got the share, nothing will be bought, otherwise we'll pay a commission, which is a small percentage of the current price. Close the position: If we've got no share previously bought, nothing will happen, otherwise we'll pay the commission for the trade. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Reward*: The agent receives a reward after each step. If a new position is entered or an existing position is closed the reward equals $100 * \\frac{(y_t - y_{t-1})}{y_{t-1}}$ minus the commission, where $y_t$ corresponds to the closing price in period $t$. If a position continues to exist the reward equals $100 * \\frac{(y_t - y_{t-1})}{y_{t-1}}$. If you set `reward_on_close=True` in the custom environment file, the agent receives a reward only once after closing the position."

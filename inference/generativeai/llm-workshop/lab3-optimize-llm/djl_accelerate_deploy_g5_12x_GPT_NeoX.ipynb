    "In this notebook, we explore how to host a large language model on SageMaker using the latest container that packages some of the most popular open source libraries for model parallel inference like DeepSpeed and Hugging Face Accelerate. We use DJLServing as the model serving solution in this example. DJLServing is a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by the Deep Java Library (DJL) that is programming language agnostic. To learn more about DJL and DJLServing, you can refer to our recent blog post (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-bloom-176b-and-opt-30b-on-amazon-sagemaker-with-large-model-inference-deep-learning-containers-and-deepspeed/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models have recently exploded in both size and popularity. In 2018, BERT-large entered the scene and, with its 340M parameters and novel transformer architecture, set the standard on NLP task accuracy. Within just a few years, state-of-the-art NLP model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and similarly sized open source Bloom 176B raising the bar on NLP accuracy. This increase in the number of parameters is driven by the simple and empirically-demonstrated positive relationship between model size and accuracy: more is better. With easy access from models zoos such as Hugging Face and improved accuracy in NLP tasks such as classification and text generation, practitioners are increasingly reaching for these large models. However, deploying them can be a challenge because of their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker has rolled out Deep Learning containers container which now provides users with the ability to leverage the managed serving capabilities and help to provide the un-differentiated heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we deploy the open source GPT-NeoX-20B model across GPUs on a ml.g5.12xlarge instance. The model is loaded using layer-wise model partitioning through [Hugging Face Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/big_modeling#designing-a-device-map). You can also quantize the model weights to int8 thereby greatly reducing the memory footprint of the model from the initial FP32.

We used Hugging Face Accelerate’s model parallel techniques to host the model on multiple GPUs on a single SageMaker machine learning instance.

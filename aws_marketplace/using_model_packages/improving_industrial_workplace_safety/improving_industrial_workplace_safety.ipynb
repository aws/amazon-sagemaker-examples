    "## Demonstrating Industrial Workplace Safety using Pre-trained Machine Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook shows how to use pre-trained model packages from [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?page=1&filters=FulfillmentOptionType&FulfillmentOptionType=SageMaker&ref_=mlmp_gitdemo_indust) to detect industrial workspace safety related object labels, such as hard-hat, personal protective equipment, construction machinery, and construction worker in an image. The notebook also shows an approach to perform inference on a video by taking snapshots from the video file to generate an activity/status log. At the end of this you will become familiar on steps to integrate inferences from pre-trained models into your application. This notebook is intended for demonstration, we highly recommend you to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning models to see if they meet your expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites:\n",
    "This sample notebook requires you to subscribe to pre-trained machine learning model packages. Follow the following steps to subscribe to the listings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the following model package product detail pages, in separate tabs, in your web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "  1.  [Construction Worker Detection](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-6utmzaproaqhs?qid=1563547984309&sr=0-5&ref_=mlmp_gitdemo_indust) to identify construction workers in an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. [Hard Hat Detector for Worker Safety](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jd5tj2egpxxum?qid=1563547984309&sr=0-2&ref_=mlmp_gitdemo_indust) model to infer if construction workers are wearing hard hats.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. [Personal Protective Equipments](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-2inbkii6o24k4?qid=1563547984309&sr=0-6&ref_=mlmp_gitdemo_indust) to infer if a person is wearing a high visibility safety vest. \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. [Construction Machines Detector](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fuukizaiq5o7c?qid=1563549078039&sr=0-1&ref_=mlmp_gitdemo_indust) to identify construction machines in an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each of the model packages, follow these steps: \n",
    "  1. Review the information available on the product details page including **Support Terms** .\n",
    "  1. Click on **\"Continue to Subscribe\"**. You will now see the **\"Subscribe to this software\"** page. \n",
    "  1. Review **End User License Agreement** and **Pricing Terms**.\n",
    "  1. **\"Accept Offer\"** button needs to be clicked if your organization agrees with EULA, pricing information and support terms.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: \n",
    "  1. Once you click on **Continue to configuration** button and then choose a region, you will see a **Product Arn** displayed. This is the model package ARN that you need to specify while creating a deployable model using Boto3.  However, for this notebook, the model ARNs have been specified in **src/model_package_arns.py** file and you need not specify them explicitly. The configuration page also provides a **\"View in SageMaker\"** button to navigate to Amazon SageMaker to deploy via Amazon SageMaker Console. \n",
    "  1. Products with **Free Trials**, do not incur hourly software charges during free trial period, but AWS infrastructure charges still apply. Free Trials will automatically convert to a paid hourly subscription upon expiration. We have included steps below to cancel subscription at the end of this exercise. "

    "\n",
    "Object detection is the process of identifying and localizing objects in an image. A typical object detection solution takes in an image as input and provides a bounding box on the image where a object of interest is along with identifying what object the box encapsulates. But before we have this solution, we need to acquire and process a traning dataset, create and setup a training job for the alorithm so that the aglorithm can learn about the dataset and then host the algorithm as an endpoint, to which we can supply the query image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an end-to-end example introducing the Amazon SageMaker Object Detection algorithm. In this demo, we will demonstrate how to train and to host an object detection model on the [Pascal VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) using the Single Shot multibox Detector ([SSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)) algorithm. In doing so, we will also demonstrate how to construct a training dataset using the RecordIO format as this is the format that the training job will consume. We will also demonstrate how to host and validate this trained model. Amazon SageMaker Object Detection also allow training with the image and JSON format, which is illustrated in the [image and JSON Notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/object_detection_pascalvoc_coco/object_detection_image_json_format.ipynb)."

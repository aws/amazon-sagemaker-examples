    "# Detect stalled training and stop training job using debugger rule\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll show you how you can use StalledTrainingRule rule which can take action like stopping your training job when it finds that there has been no update in training job for certain threshold duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does StalledTrainingRule works?\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Sagemaker debugger automatically captures tensors from training job which use AWS DLC(tensorflow, pytorch, mxnet, xgboost)[refer doc for supported versions](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/sagemaker.md#zero-script-change). StalledTrainingRule keeps watching on emission of tensors like loss. The execution happens outside of training containers. It is evident that if training job is running good and is not stalled it is expected to emit loss and metrics tensors at frequent intervals. If Rule doesn't find new tensors being emitted from training job for threshold period of time, it takes automatic action to issue StopTrainingJob.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With no changes to your training script\n",
    "If you use one of the SageMaker provided [Deep Learning Containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html). [Refer doc for supported framework versions](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/sagemaker.md#zero-script-change), then you don't need to make any changes to your training script for activating this rule. Loss tensors will automatically be captured and monitored by the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also emit tensors periodically by using [save scalar api of hook](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/api.md#common-hook-api) . \n",
    "\n",
    "Also look at example how to use save_scalar api [here](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/examples/tensorflow2/scripts/tf_keras_fit_non_eager.py#L42)"

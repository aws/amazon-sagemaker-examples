    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The SageMaker Training Compiler allows AWS customers to train deep learning models faster on scalable GPU instances managed by SageMaker. The memory optimizations made by SageMaker Training Compiler typically allow for your training job to fit more data into GPU memory. By increasing the batch size as much as possible in your training job, you can speed up your training jobs even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a TensorFlow fine-tuning job (Sequence_Len=512, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)) with a GPT-2 model from Hugging Face, the maximum batch size that can fit on a ml.p3.2xlarge instance increased from 6 to 20 with the Training Compiler enabled. A list of model examples and maximum batch sizes is available in the SageMaker Training Compiler documentation under \"Tested Models\": https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/training-compiler-support.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Notebook is to give you an example of how you can find the max batch size for a particular model and instance type. We show you how to find the max batch size for a gpt2 model below running on a `ml.p3.8xlarge` instance. You can customize this Notebook to fit your use case, and use the resulting max batch size as the value of your batch size parameter in your full training job.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook uses the HuggingFace training scripts (`run_mlm.py` and `run_clm.py`) and a hands-on script (`find_max_batch_size.py`) to iteratively search for the maximum batch for a given GPU instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook runs the `run_clm.py` by default, as will be shown in the following sections. If you want to test with your own training script, you need to update the following:\n",
    "- The `find_max_batch_size.py` script - In line 23 to 28 of the script, specify the right directory path and the file name of your training script.\n",
    "- `hyperparameters` - In the following Tune a Native TensorFlow Training Job section, modify the hyperparameters that your training script requires accordingly."

    "SageMaker Training Compiler improves the efficiency of your training job by typically decreasing the memory footprint of the job. In this notebook, you found the largest `batch_size` that can fit in memory with Training Compiler's optimizations. Increasing the `batch_size` can decrease the time needed to train a model, reducing cost and enabling faster iteration.\n",

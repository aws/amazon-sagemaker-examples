    "## Introduction to training a model using data from AWS Data Exchange and an algorithm from AWS Marketplace\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a tendency to get attracted to certain fragrant elements or a combination of elements. These combination of elements play an important role in our psychophysiological activity as explained in this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198031/). Although each of us is unique and has unique fragrance preferences, there are certain combinations of elements that are widely popular. Understanding these combinations is quite important when you are creating products that would appeal to masses. Having a decision support system that can tell you whether products in a product line you wish to launch contain those elements or not can be immensly beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will conduct an experiment to identify combination of elements that are widely popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of our experiment, we would use product popularity dataset containing information of Bath and Body works products, a popular bath products company, and train a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model would be based on two simple features:\n",
    "1. Name of the product\n",
    "2. Category of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "For training a machine learning model, we would use a third-party decision forest classification algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You may use any algorithm supported by Amazon SageMaker for training a model. However, for this experiment, we would use a third-party algorithm from AWS Marketplace.\n",

    "1. A Dataset : [VK Retail Data Sets Trial product](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange/home?region=us-east-1#/products/prodview-gq5plolrup4va)\n",
    "2. An Algorithm : [Intel®DAAL DecisionForest Classification](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-begzvcpjty3g2?qid=1569615711264&sr=0-2&ref_=srh_res_product_title)\n",

    "If your AWS account has not been subscribed to these listings, here is the process you can follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subscribe to data from AWS Data Exchange:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the [VK Retail Data Sets Trial product](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange/home?region=us-east-1#/products/prodview-gq5plolrup4va) from AWS Data Exchange console\n",
    "2. Read the overview and other information such as pricing, usage, support. \n",
    "3. Choose __Continue to Subscribe__\n",
    "4. If your organization agrees to subscription terms, pricing information, and  Data subscription agreement, then review/update the renewal settings and choose __Subscribe__\n",
    "5. Once subscription has been successfully created (This step may take 5-10 minutes), you will find the dataset listed in the [__Subscriptions__](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange/home?region=us-east-1#/subscriptions) section of the console\n",
    "6. From [subscription page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange/home?region=us-east-1#/subscriptions), open **Retail Data Sets (TRIAL)**,  and for this use-case, choose the __retail_trials-bathbodyworks__ dataset. This is the dataset we would use to train a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subscribe to algorithm from AWS Marketplace:\n",
    "1. Open the [Intel®DAAL DecisionForest Classification listing](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-begzvcpjty3g2?qid=1569615711264&sr=0-2&ref_=srh_res_product_title) from AWS Marketplace\n",
    "2. Read the **Highlights** section and then **product overview** section of the listing.\n",
    "3. View **usage information** and then **additional resources**.\n",
    "4. Note the supported instance types.\n",
    "5. Next, click on **Continue to subscribe**.\n",
    "6. Review **End user license agreement**, **support terms**, as well as **pricing information**.\n",
    "7. **\"Accept Offer\"** button needs to be clicked if your organization agrees with EULA, pricing information as well as support terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**: \n",
    "1. If **Continue to configuration** button is active, it means your account already has a subscription to this listing.\n",
    "2. Once you click on **Continue to configuration** button and then choose region, you will see that a **Product Arn** will appear. This is the model package ARN that you need to specify while creating a deployable model. However, for this notebook, the algorithm ARN has been specified in **src/model_package_arns.py** file and you do not need to specify the same explicitly."

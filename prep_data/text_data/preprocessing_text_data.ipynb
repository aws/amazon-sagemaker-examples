    "# Preprocessing Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how to preprocessing text data for next-step feature engineering and training a machine learning model via Amazon SageMaker. In this notebook we will focus on preprocessing our text data. We are going to discuss many possible methods to clean and enrich your text, but you do not need to run through every single step below. Usually, a rule of thumb is: if you are dealing with very noisy text, like social media text data, or nurse notes, then medium to heavy preprocessing effort might be needed, and if it's domain-specific corpus, text enrichment is helpful as well; if you are dealing with long and well-written documents such as news articles and papers, very light preprocessing is needed; you can add some enrichment to the data to better capture the sentence to sentence relationship and overall meaning. \n"

    "## Overview\n",
    "### Input Format  \n",
    "Labeled text data sometimes are in a structured data format. You might come across this when working on reviews for sentiment analysis, news headlines for topic modeling, or documents for text classification. One column of the dataset could be dedicated for the label, one column for the text, and sometimes other columns as attributes. You can process this dataset format similar to how you would process tabular data (see [Preprocessing Tabular Data](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/prep_data/tabular_data/01_preprocessing_tabular_data.ipynb) for an example). Sometimes text data, especially raw text data, comes as unstructured data and is often in .json or .txt format. To work with this type of formatting, you will need to first extract useful information from the original dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "Text data contains rich information and it's everywhere. Applicable use cases include Voice of Customer (VOC), fraud detection, warranty analysis, chatbot and customer service routing, audience analysis, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the difference between preprocessing and feature engineering for text data?\n",
    "In the preprocessing stage, you want to clean and transfer the text data from human language to standard, machine-analyzable format for further processing. For feature engineering, you extract predictive factors (features) from the text. For example, for a matching equivalent question pairs task, the features you can extract include words overlap, cosine similarity, inter-word relationships, parse tree structure similarity, TF-IDF (frequency-inverse document frequency) scores, etc.; for some language model like topic modeling, words embeddings themselves can also be features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When is my text data ready for feature engineering?\n",
    "When the data is ready to be vectorized and fit your specific use case."

    "There are several python packages designed specifically for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this notebook, you will use the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [nltk (natrual language toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/), a leading platform includes multiple text processing libraries, which covers almost all aspects of preprocessing we will discuss in this section: tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, parsing, chunking, POS tagging, stop words, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/), offers most functionality provided by `nltk`, and provides pre-trained word vectors and models. It is scalable and designed for production usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Gensim (Generate Similar)](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/about.html), \"designed specifically for topic modeling, document indexing, and similarity retrieval with large corpora\". \n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextBlo`](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/), offers POS tagging, noun phrases extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, parsing, n-grams, word inflation, all offered as an API to perform more advanced NLP tasks. It is an easy-to-use wrapper for libraries like `nltk` and `Pattern`. We will use this package for our enrichment tasks."

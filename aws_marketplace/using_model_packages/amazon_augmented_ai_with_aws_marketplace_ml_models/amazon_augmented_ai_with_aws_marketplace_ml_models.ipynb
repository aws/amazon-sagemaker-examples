    "Sometimes, for some payloads, machine learning (ML) model predictions are just not confident enough and you want more than a machine. Furthermore, training a model can be complicated, time-consuming, and expensive. This is where [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/b/6297422012?page=1&filters=FulfillmentOptionType&FulfillmentOptionType=SageMaker&ref_=sa_campaign_pbrao) and [Amazon Augmented AI](https://aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/) (Amazon A2I) come in. By combining a pretrained ML model in AWS Marketplace with Amazon Augmented AI, you can quickly reap the benefits of pretrained models with validating and augmenting the model's accuracy with human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Marketplace contains over 400 pretrained ML models. Some models are general purpose. For example, the [GluonCV SSD Object Detector](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ggbuxlnrm2lh4?qid=1605041213915&sr=0-5&ref_=sa_campaign_pbrao) can detect objects in an image and place bounding boxes around the objects. AWS Marketplace also offers many purpose-built models such as a [Background Noise Classifier](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-vpd6qdjm4d7u4?applicationId=AWS-Sagemaker-Console&ref_=sa_campaign_pbrao), a [Hard Hat Detector for Worker Safety](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jd5tj2egpxxum?applicationId=AWS-Sagemaker-Console&ref_=sa_campaign_pbrao), and a [Person in Water](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-wlndemzv5pxhw?applicationId=AWS-Sagemaker-Console&ref_=sa_campaign_pbrao).\n",

    "In this notebook, you will use a pre-trained AWS Marketplace machine learning model with Amazon A2I to detect images as well as trigger a human-in-loop workflow to review, update and add additional labeled objects to an individual image. Furthermore, you can specify configurable threshold criteria for triggering the human-in-loop workflow in Amazon A2I. For example, you can trigger a human-in-loop workflow if there are no objects that are detected with an accuracy of 90% or greater.\n",

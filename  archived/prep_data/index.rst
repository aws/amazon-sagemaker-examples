Get started with data prep
==========================

SageMaker has several options for data preparation.
The options best for you will depend on your use case, the kind of data, volume of data, and timing of how often you need to process the data.
The following examples and guides can help you get started.
Each includes example datasets for you to experiment with.
If you want to use your own data, start with the `data ingestion examples <../data_ingestion/index.html>`_.

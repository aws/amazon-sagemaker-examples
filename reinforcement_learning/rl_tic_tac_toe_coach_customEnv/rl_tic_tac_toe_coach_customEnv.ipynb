    "Tic-tac-toe is one of the first games children learn to play and was one of the [first computer games ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OXO).  Optimal play through exhaustive search is relatively straightforward, however, approaching with a reinforcement learning agent can be educational.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to train a reinforcement learning agent with SageMaker RL and then play locally and interactively within the notebook.  Unlike SageMaker local mode, this method does not require a docker container to run locally, instead using an endpoint and integration with a small Jupyter app (*Note, this app does not work in JupyterLab*).\n",

    "Our tic-tac-toe example requires 3 scripts in order to train our agent using SageMaker RL.  The scripts are placed in the `./src` directory which is sent to the container when the SageMaker training job is initiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "For our tic-tac-toe use case we'll create a custom Gym environment.  This means we'll specify a Python class which inherits from `gym.Env` and has two methods: `reset()` and `step()`.  These will provide the agent its state, actions, and rewards for learning.  In more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` method is called at the beginning of the SageMaker training job and:\n",
    "1. Starts the 3x3 tic-tac-toe board as a NumPy array of zeros\n",
    "1. Prepares the state space as a flattened version of the board (length 9)\n",
    "1. Defines a discrete action space with 9 possible options (one for each place on the board)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reset()` method is called at the beginning of each episode and:\n",
    "1. Clears the 3x3 board (sets all values to 0)\n",
    "1. Does some minor record-keeping for tracking across tic-tac-toe games\n",
    "\n",
    "The `step()` method is called for each iteration in an episode and:\n",
    "1. Adjusts the board based on the action chosen by the agent based on the previous state\n",
    "1. Generates rewards based on performance\n",
    "1. Automatically chooses the move for the agent's opponent if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "* The opponent has not been programmed for perfect play.  If we taught our agent against a perfect opponent, it would not generalize to scenarios where the rules of perfect play were not followed.\n",
    "* If our agent selects an occupied space, it is given a minor penalty (-0.1) and asked to choose again.  Although the state doesn't change across these steps (meaning the agent's network's prediction should stay the same), randomness in the agent should eventually result in different actions.  However, if the agent chooses an occupied space 10 times in a row, the game is forfeit.  Selecting an action only from available spaces would require more substantial modification than was desired for this example.\n",
    "* Other rewards only occur when a game is completed (+1 for win, 0 for draw, -1 for loss).\n",
    "* The board is saved as a NumPy array where a value of +1 represents our agent's moves (`X`s) and a value of -1 represents the opponent's moves (`O`s)."

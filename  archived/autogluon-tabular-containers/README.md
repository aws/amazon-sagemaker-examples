# AutoGluon Tabular with Amazon SageMaker

[AutoGluon](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon) automates machine learning tasks enabling you to easily achieve strong predictive performance in your applications. With just a few lines of code, you can train and deploy high-accuracy deep learning models on tabular, image, and text data.
This example shows how to use AutoGluon-Tabular with Amazon SageMaker by applying [pre-built deep learning containers](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md#autogluon-training-containers).

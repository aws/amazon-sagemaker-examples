    "# Amazon SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoints using Linear Learner\n",
    "With [Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/multi-model-endpoints.html), customers can create an endpoint that seamlessly hosts up to thousands of models. These endpoints are well suited to use cases where any one of a large number of models, which can be served from a common inference container, needs to be invokable on-demand and where it is acceptable for infrequently invoked models to incur some additional latency. For applications which require consistently low inference latency, a traditional endpoint is still the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, Amazon SageMaker manages the loading and unloading of models for a multi-model endpoint, as they are needed. When an invocation request is made for a particular model, Amazon SageMaker routes the request to an instance assigned to that model, downloads the model artifacts from S3 onto that instance, and initiates loading of the model into the memory of the container. As soon as the loading is complete, Amazon SageMaker performs the requested invocation and returns the result. If the model is already loaded in memory on the selected instance, the downloading and loading steps are skipped and the invocation is performed immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker inference pipeline model consists of a sequence of containers that serve inference requests by combining preprocessing, predictions and post-processing data science tasks.  An inference pipeline allows you to apply the same preprocessing code used during model training, to process the inference request data used for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how multi-model endpoints are created and used with inference pipeline, this notebook provides an example using a set of Linear Learner models that each predict housing prices for a single location. This domain is used as a simple example to easily experiment with multi-model endpoints.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases three MME capabilities: \n",
    "* Native MME support with Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner algorithm.  Because of the native support there is no need for you to create a custom container.  \n",
    "* Native MME support with Amazon SageMaker Inference Pipelines.\n",
    "* Granual InvokeModel access to multiple models hosted on the MME using IAM condition key.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate these capabilities, the notebook discusses the use case of predicting house prices in multiple cities using linear regression.  House prices are predicted based on features like number of bedrooms, number of garages, square footage etc.  Depending on the city, the features effect the house price differently.  For example, small changes in the square footage cause a drastic change in house prices in NewYork when compared to price changes in Houston.  For accurate house price predictions, we will train multiple linear regression models, a unique location specific model per city.  \n"

Therefore, the model invocation may longer when it is invoked for the first time. And after the model is already in the instance container’s memory, the subsequent invocations will be faster. If an instance memory utilization is high and a new model needs to be loaded then unused models are unloaded.  The unloaded models will remain in the instance’s storage volume and can be loaded into container’s memory later without being downloaded from the S3 bucket again.  If the instance’s storage volume if full, unused models are deleted from storage volume.    \n",

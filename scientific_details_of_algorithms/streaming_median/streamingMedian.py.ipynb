    "In this notebook, we will use an extremely simple \"machine learning\" task to learn about streaming algorithms. We will try to find the median of some numbers in batch mode, random order streams, and arbitrary order streams.\n",

    "\n",
    "The task at hand will be to approximate the median (model) of a long sequence of numbers (the data). This might seem to have little to do with machine learning. We are used to thinking of a median, $m$, of number $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ in the context of statistics as the number, $m$, which is smaller than at most half the values $x_i$ and larger than at most half the values $x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the median, however, also solves a proper machine learning optimization problem (albeit a simple one). The median minimizes the following clustering-like objective function\n",
    "$$m = \\min_x \\frac1n\\sum_i|x - x_i|.$$\n",
    "In fact, the median is the solution to the well studied k-median clustering problem in one dimension and $k=1$. Moreover, the extension to finding all quantiles is common in feature transformations and an important ingedient in speeding up decission tree training."

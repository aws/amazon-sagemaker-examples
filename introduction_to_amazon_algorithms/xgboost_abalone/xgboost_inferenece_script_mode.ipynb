    "- `predict_fn`: Takes the deserialized request object and performs inference against the loaded model, and\n",
    "- `output_fn`: Takes the result of prediction and serializes this according to the response content type.\n",
    "We will write a customized inference script that is designed to illustrate how [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) values enable the interpretion of XGBoost models.\n",

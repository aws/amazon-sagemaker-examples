    "### Description\n",
    "Heterogeneous clusters enable launching training jobs that use multiple instance types in a single job. This capability can improve your training cost and speed by running different parts of the model training on the most suitable instance type. This use case typically happens in computer vision DL training, where training is bottleneck on CPU resources needed for data augmentation, leaving the expensive GPU underutilized. Heterogeneous clusters enable you to add more CPU resources to fully utilize GPUs, thus increase training speed and cost-efficiency. For more details, you can find the documentation of this feature [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/train-heterogeneous-cluster.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Heterogeneous Cluster feature of SageMaker Training with PyTorch.  The notebook works on Python 3 (_PyTorch 1.12 Python 3.8 CPU Optimized_) image of SageMaker Studio Notebook instance, and runs on _ml.t3.medium_ instance type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook covers:\n",
    "- Setting up SageMaker Studio Notebook \n",
    "- Setting up the Training environment \n",
    "- Submit a Training job\n",
    "- Monitor and visualize the CloudWatch metrics\n",
    "- Comparing time-to-train and cost-to-train\n",
    "- Considerations\n",
    "- Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample notebook, we have taken the PyTorch model based on this [official MNIST example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/MNIST). We modified the training code to be heavy on data pre-processing. We are going to train this model in both Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Cluster modes. The flag to train on any of these modes can be set using `IS_HETERO = False or True` in section **B.2 Configure environment variables**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneous Training Job - In this baseline we observe an ml.p3.2xlarge with an under-utilized GPU due to a CPU bottleneck. \n",
    "<img src=images/homogeneous-cluster-diagram.png alt=\"homogeneous-training job\" />  \n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous Training Job - Where we add ml.c5.9xlarge instance for extra CPU cores, to allow increased GPU usage of ml.p3.2xlarge instance, and improve cost-efficiency. Both the jobs runs the training code, train data set, pre-processing, and other relevant parameters.\n",
    "<img src=images/heterogeneous-cluster-diagram.png alt=\"heterogeneous-training job\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In homogeneous cluster training job, the data pre-processing and Deep Neural Network (DNN) training code runs on the same instance. However, in heterogeneous cluster training job, the data pre-processing code runs on the CPU nodes (here by referred as **data_group or data group**), whereas the Deep Neural Network (DNN) training code runs on the GPU nodes (here referred as **dnn_group or dnn group**). The inter-node communication between the data and dnn groups is handled by generic implementation of [gRPC client-server interface](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/basics/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The script (`launcher.py`) has the logic to detect (using SageMaker environment variables) whether the node it is running on belongs to data_group or dnn_group. If it is data_group, it spawns a separate process by executing `train_data.py`. This script runs grpc-server service for extracting processed training batches using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview). The gRPC server running on the data_group listens on a specific port (ex. 6000). In the code (`train_data.py`) documentation, we have chosen an implementation that keeps the data loading logic intact  where data batches are entered into a shared queue. The `get_samples` function of the `DataFeedService` pulls batches from the same queue and sends them to the client in the form of a continuous data stream. While fetching the data, the main entrypoint script `launcher.py` listens on port 16000 for a shutdown request coming from gRPC client i.e. data group. The `train_data.py` waits for shutdown action from the parent process. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the node belongs to dnn_group, the main training script (`launcher.py`) spawns a separate set of processes by executing `train_dnn.py`. The script runs gRPC client code and DNN component of the training job. It consumes the processed training data from the gRPC server. We have defined an iterable PyTorch dataset, RemoteDataset, that opens a connection to the gRPC server, and reads from a stream of data batches. Once the model is trained with all the batches of training data, the gRPC client exits, and the parent process`launcher.py` sends a shutdown request on port 16000. This indicates the gRPC server to shutdown, and signals ends of the training job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the workflow looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=images/pytorch-heterogeneous-workflow.png width=600px>\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook runs a training job on 2 instances, 1 in each node group. The data_group uses ml.c5.9xlarge whereas dnn_group uses ml.p3.2xlarge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook refers following files and folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Folders: \n",
    "  - `code`: this has the training (data pre-processing and dnn) scripts, and grpc client-server start and shutdown scripts\n",
    "  - `images`: contains images referred in notebook\n",
    "- Files: \n",
    "  - `launcher.py`: entry point training script. This script is executed on all the nodes irrespective of which group it belongs to. This is a parent process that makes a decision on where to spawn a data pre-processing or dnn component of the training job. The script runs on all the nodes as entry point. It also handles the shutdown logic for gRPC server. \n",
    "  - `train_data.py`, `dataset_feed_pb2.py`, `dataset_feed_pb2_grpc.py`: these scripts run on the data_group nodes and responsible for setting up grpc-server, start and shutdown.\n",
    "  - `train_dnn.py`: this script runs dnn code on the training data set. It fetches preprocessed data from the data_group node as a stream using gRPC client-server communication. It also sends a shutdown request after all the iterations on the preprocessed training data set. \n",
    "  - `requirement.txt`: defines package required for gRPC \n",
    "  - `train.py`: this script is the entry point script for SageMaker homogeneous cluster training. This script is picked up when you choose IS_HETERO = False. This uses a local dataset and runs both data pre-processing and a dnn component on the same node. "

    "Click on **View instance metrics** from the **Training jobs** node in **Amazon SageMaker Console**. In the run above, all 30 vCPU of Data node (algo-1) is approx. 100% utilized, and the GPU utilization is at 100% at frequent intervals in the DNN node (algo-2). To rescale the CloudWatch Metrics to 100% on CPU utilization for algo-1 and algo-2, use CloudWatch \"Add Math\" feature and average it out by no. of cores on those instance types.\n",

    "## E. Comparing time-to-train and cost-to-train\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue with the above example i.e. train a heavy data pre-processing (CPU intensive) model (MNIST) requiring only 1 GPU. We start with ml.p3.2xlarge (1xV100 GPU, 8x vCPU) in homogeneous cluster mode to get the baseline performance numbers. Due to the no. of CPU cores, we could not go beyond 8 data loader/workers for data pre-processing. The avg. step cost was `7.6 cents` and avg. step time is `1.19 seconds`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to reduce the cost and speed up the model training time. The first choice here is to scale up the instance type in the same family. If we leverage the next instance type (4 GPU) in the P3 family, the GPUs would have gone underutilized. In this case, we needed more vCPU to GPU ratio. Assuming we haven't had any instance type in another instance family or the model is incompatible with the CPU/GPU architectures of other instance families, we are constrained to use ml.p3.2xlarge. The only way then to have more vCPUs to GPU ratio is to use SageMaker feature, Heterogeneous Cluster, which enables customers to offload data pre-processing logic to CPU only instance types example ml.c5. In the next test, we offloaded CPU intensive work i.e. data preprocessing to ml.c5.9xlarge (36 vCPU) and continued using ml.p3.2xlarge for DNN. The avg. step cost was `1.9 cents` and avg. step time is `0.18 seconds`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we reduced the training cost by 4.75 times, and the avg. step reduced by 6.5 times. This was possible because with higher cpu count, we could use 32 data loader workers (compared to 8 with p3.2xl) to preprocess the data, and kept GPU close to 100% utilized at frequent intervals. Note: These numbers are just taken as a sample, you have to do benchmarking with your own model and dataset to come up with the exact price-performance benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "## F. Considerations\n",
    "This PyTorch example implementation of gRPC client-server supports a single instance in each instance group. You may like to extend the logic to support multiple instances in the instance group. \n",
    "\n",
    "## G. Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how to leverage heterogeneous cluster feature of SageMaker Training to achieve better price performance. To get started you can copy this example project, and only change the `train_dnn.py` script.\n"

    "## Description of Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is NP-complete as the number of combinations of cities grows larger as we add more cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the classic version of the problem, the salesman picks a city to start, travels through remaining cities and returns to the original city. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this version, we have slightly modified the problem, presenting it as a restaurant order delivery problem on a 2D gridworld.  The agent (driver) starts at the restaurant, a fixed point on the grid.  Then, delivery orders appear elsewhere on the grid.  The driver needs to visit the orders, and return to the restaurant, to obtain rewards.  Rewards are proportional to the time taken to do this (equivalent to the distance, as each timestep moves one square on the grid)."

    "## Why Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "For canonical Operations problems like this one, we're very interested about RL's potential to push the state of the art.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons we think RL offers some unique value for this type of problem:\n",
    "1. RL seems to perform well in high-dimensional spaces, when an approximate solution to a complex problem may be of greater value than an exact/optimal solution to a simpler problem.\n",
    "2. RL can do quite well in partially observed environments.  When there are aspects of a problem we don't know about and therefore can't model, which is often the case in the real-world (and we can pretend is the case with these problems), RL's ability to deal with the messiness is valuable.\n",
    "3. RL may have things to teach us!  We've seen this to be the case with Go, and Dota 2, where the RL agent came up with innovative strategies that have later been adopted by human players.  What if there are clever strategies we can use to solve versions of TSP, Knapsack, Newsvendor, or extensions of any of those?  RL might surprise us."

    "## Easy Version of TSP\n",
    "In the Easy Version, we are on a 5x5 grid.  All orders are generated at the start of the episode.  Order locations are fixed, and are invariant (non-random) from episode to episode.  The objective is to visit each order location, and return to the restaurant.  We have a maximum time-limit of 50 steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### States\n",
    "At each time step, our agent is aware of the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the Restuarant:\n",
    "    1. Location (x,y coordinates)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. For the Driver\n",
    "    1. Location (x,y coordinates)\n",
    "    2. Is driver at restaurant (yes/no)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each Order: \n",
    "    1. Location (x,y coordinates)\n",
    "    2. Status (Delivered or Not Delivered)\n",
    "    3. Time (Time taken to deliver reach order -- incrementing until delivered)\n",
    "4. Miscellaneous\n",
    "    1. Time since start of episode\n",
    "    2. Time remaining until end of episode (i.e. until max time)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions\n",
    "At each time step, our agent can take the following steps:\n",
    "- Up - Move one step up in the map\n",
    "- Down - Move one step down in the map\n",
    "- Right - Move one step right in the map\n",
    "- Left - Move one step left in the map\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewards\n",
    "Agent gets a reward of -1 for each time step. If an order is delivered in that timestep, it gets a positive reward inversely proportional to the time taken to deliver. If all the orders are delivered and the agent is back to the restaurant, it gets an additional reward inversely proportional to time since start of episode. \n"

    "## Vehicle Routing Problem with Reinforcement Learning <a name=\"VRP-Easy\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a similar problem where the algorithm optimizes the movement of a fleet of vehicles. Our VRP formulation is a bit different, we have a delivery driver who accepts orders from customers, picks up food from a restaurant and delivers it to the customer. The driver optimizes to increase the number of successful deliveries within a time limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key differences from TSP: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Pathing is now automatic.  Instead of choosing \"left, right, up, down\", now you just select your destination as your action.  The environment will get you there in the fewest steps possible.\n",
    "- Since the routing/pathing is now taken care of, we add in complexity elsewhere...\n",
    "- There can be more than one restaurant, each with a different type of order (e.g. Pizzas vs. Burritos).  Each order will have a different type, and you have to visit the correct restuarant to pick up an order before dropping it off.\n",
    "- Drivers have a limited capacity; they cannot pick up an infinite number of orders.  Instead, they can only have (e.g. 5) orders in the car at any given time.  This means they will have to return to the restaurant(s) in between deliveries to pick up more supply.\n",
    "- Orders now come in dynamically over time, rather than all being known at time zero.  Each time step, there is some probability that an order will be generated.  \n",
    "- As the driver/agent, we now have the choice to fulfill an order or not -- there's no penalty associated with not accepting an order, but a potential penalty if we accept an order and fail to deliver it before Timeout.\n",

    "    5. Promise (If you deliver the order by this time, you get a bonus reward)\n",
    "    6. Timeout (If you deliver the order after this time, you get a penalty)\n",
    "\n",

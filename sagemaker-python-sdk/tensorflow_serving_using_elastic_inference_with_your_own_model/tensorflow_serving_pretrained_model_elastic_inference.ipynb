    "# Using Amazon Elastic Inference with a pre-trained TensorFlow Serving model on SageMaker\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to enable and use Amazon Elastic Inference with our predefined SageMaker TensorFlow Serving containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Elastic Inference (EI) is a resource you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instances to accelerate your deep learning (DL) inference workloads. EI allows you to add inference acceleration to an Amazon SageMaker hosted endpoint or Jupyter notebook for a fraction of the cost of using a full GPU instance. For more information please visit: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ei.html\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's main objective is to show how to create an endpoint, backed by an Elastic Inference, to serve our pre-trained TensorFlow Serving model for predictions. With a more efficient cost per performance, Amazon Elastic Inference can prove to be useful for those looking to use GPUs for higher inference performance at a lower cost.\n",

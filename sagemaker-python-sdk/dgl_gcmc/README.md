# Example Recommender System Using Deep Graph Library with a Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion Network
This example is a recommender system for movie reviews. It uses a graph convolutional matrix completion (GCMC) network trained on the MovieLens datasets. These datasets consist of movie titles, genres, and ratings by users.

It uses [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) as its backend. [MXNet built with large tensor support](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/faq/large_tensor_support) is required. This example shows you how you can build your own container with the necessary dependencies to run the network on Amazon SageMaker.

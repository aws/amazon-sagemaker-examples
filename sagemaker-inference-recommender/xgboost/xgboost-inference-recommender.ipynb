    "This notebook discussed how to use SageMaker Inference Recommender with an XGBoost model to help determine the right CPU instance to reduce costs and maximize performance. The notebook walked you through training a quick XGBoost model, registering your model in Model Registry, and creating an Inference Recommender Default job to get recommendations. You can modify the batch size, features and instance types to match your own ML workload as well as bring your own XGBoost model for testing."

This example is in .Rmd file format that is not displayed nicely on Github. 

When you save a .Rmd file on RStudio on SageMaker, the equivalent .html file is generated that contains a nicer view of the code & output of the file.

To view this example, it is suggested that you download the .html file and open it using the browser of your choice.

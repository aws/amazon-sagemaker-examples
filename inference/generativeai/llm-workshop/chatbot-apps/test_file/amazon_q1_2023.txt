“There’s a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, particularly amidst an uncertain economy,” said Andy
Jassy, Amazon CEO. “Our Stores business is continuing to improve the cost to serve in our fulfillment network while
increasing the speed with which we get products into the hands of customers (we expect to have our fastest Prime delivery
speeds ever in 2023). Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning
investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong
results for brands. And, while our AWS business navigates companies spending more cautiously in this macro environment, we
continue to prioritize building long-term customer relationships both by helping customers save money and enabling them to
more easily leverage technologies like Large Language Models and Generative AI with our uniquely cost-effective machine
learning chips (“Trainium” and “Inferentia”), managed Large Language Models (“Bedrock”), and AI code companion
CodeWhisperer. We like the fundamentals we’re seeing in AWS, and believe there’s much growth ahead

    "# Text Classification with Amazon SageMaker BlazingText and Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic model tuning, also known as hyperparameter tuning, finds the best version of a model by running many jobs that test a range of hyperparameters on your dataset. You choose the tunable hyperparameters, a range of values for each, and an objective metric. You choose the objective metric from the metrics that the algorithm computes. Automatic model tuning searches the hyperparameters chosen to find the combination of values that result in the model that optimizes the objective metric.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Classification can be used to solve various use-cases like sentiment analysis, spam detection, hashtag prediction etc. This notebook demonstrates the use of SageMaker BlazingText to perform supervised binary/multi class with single or multi label text classification. BlazingText can train the model on more than a billion words in a couple of minutes using a multi-core CPU or a GPU, while achieving performance on par with the state-of-the-art deep learning text classification algorithms. BlazingText extends the fastText text classifier to leverage GPU acceleration using custom CUDA kernels."

The notebook `Amazon_JumpStart_Tabular_Classification_LightGBM_CatBoost.ipynb` demonstrates how to use the JumpStart API for tabular data classification using two popular algorithms: LightGBM and CatBoost. Tabular classification is the task of assigning a class to an example of structured or relational data. The JumpStart API for tabular classification can be used for classification of an example in two classes (binary classification) or more than two classes (multi-class classification).

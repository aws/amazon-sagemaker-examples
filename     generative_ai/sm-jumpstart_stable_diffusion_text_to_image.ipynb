    "Welcome to Amazon [SageMaker JumpStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html)! You can use JumpStart to solve many Machine Learning tasks through one-click in SageMaker Studio, or through [SageMaker JumpStart API](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-prebuilt-models-with-sagemaker-jumpstart).  In this demo notebook, we demonstrate how to use the JumpStart API to generate images from text using state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion models. Furthermore, we show how to fine-tune the model to your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image model that enables you to create photorealistic images from just a text prompt. A diffusion model trains by learning to remove noise that was added to a real image. This de-noising process generates a realistic image. These models can also generate images from text alone by conditioning the generation process on the text. For instance, Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion where the model learns to recognize shapes in a pure noise image and gradually brings these shapes into focus if the shapes match the words in the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training and deploying large models and running inference on models such as Stable Diffusion is often challenging and include issues such as cuda out of memory, payload size limit exceeded and so on.  JumpStart simplifies this process by providing ready-to-use scripts that have been robustly tested. Furthermore, it provides guidance on each step of the process including the recommended instance types, how to select parameters to guide image generation process, prompt engineering etc. Moreover, you can deploy and run inference on any of the 80+ Diffusion models from JumpStart without having to write any piece of your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this notebook, you will learn how to use JumpStart to generate highly realistic and artistic images of any subject/object/environment/scene. This may be as simple as an image of a cute dog or as detailed as a hyper-realistic image of a beautifully decoraded cozy kitchen by pixer in the style of greg rutkowski with dramatic sunset lighting and long shadows with cinematic atmosphere. This can be used to design products and build catalogs for ecommerce business needs or to generate realistic art pieces or stock images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this notebook, you will learn how to use JumpStart to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to your dataset. This can be useful when creating art, logos, custom designs, NFTs, and so on, or fun stuff such as generating custom AI images of your pets or avatars of yourself.\n",

    "Writing a good prompt can sometime be an art. It is often difficult to predict whether a certain prompt will yield a satisfactory image with a given model. However, there are certain templates that have been observed to work. Broadly, a prompt can be roughly broken down into three pieces: (i) type of image (photograph/sketch/painting etc.), (ii) description (subject/object/environment/scene etc.) and (iii) the style of the image (realistic/artistic/type of art etc.). You can change each of the three parts individually to generate variations of an image. Adjectives have been known to play a significant role in the image generation process. Also, adding more details help in the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a realistic image, you can use phrases such as “a photo of”, “a photograph of”, “realistic” or “hyper realistic”. To generate images by artists you can use phrases like “by Pablo   Piccaso” or “oil painting by Rembrandt” or “landscape art by Frederic Edwin Church” or “pencil drawing by Albrecht Dürer”. You can also combine different artists as well. To generate artistic image by category, you can add the art category in the prompt such as “lion on a beach, abstract”. Some other categories include “oil painting”, “pencil drawing, “pop art”, “digital art”, “anime”, “cartoon”, “futurism”, “watercolor”, “manga” etc. You can also include details such as lighting or camera lens such as 35mm wide lens or 85mm wide lens and details about the framing (portrait/landscape/close up etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that model generates different images even if same prompt is given multiple times. So, you can generate multiple images and select the image that suits your application best.\n",

    "### 4. Conclusion\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this tutorial, we learnt how to deploy a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model on SageMaker using JumpStart. We saw that Stable Diffusion models can generate highly photo-realistic images from text.  JumpStart provides both Stable Diffusion 1 and Stable Diffusion 2 and their FP16 revisions. JumpStart also provides additional 84 diffusion models which have been trained to generate images from different themes and different languages. You can deploy any of these models without writing any code of your own.  To deploy a specific model, you can select a `model_id` in the dropdown menu in [2.1. Select a Model](#2.1.-Select-a-Model).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can tweak the image generation process by selecting the appropriate parameters during inference. Guidance on how to set these parameters is provided in [2.4. Supported Inference parameters](#2.4.-Supported-Inference-parameters). We also saw how returning a large image payload can lead to response size limit issues. JumpStart handles it by encoding the image at the endpoint and decoding it in the notebook before displaying. Finally, we saw how prompt engineering is a crucial step in generating high quality images. We discussed how to set your own prompts and saw a some examples of good prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Inference on pre-trained Stable Diffusion models, please check out the blog [Generate images from text with the stable diffusion model on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/generate-images-from-text-with-the-stable-diffusion-model-on-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although creating impressive images can find use in industries ranging from art to NFTs and beyond, today we also expect AI to be personalizable. JumpStart provides fine-tuning capability to the pre-trained models so that you can adapt the model to your own use case with as little as five training images. This can be useful when creating art, logos, custom designs, NFTs, and so on, or fun stuff such as generating custom AI images of your pets or avatars of yourself. To learn more about Stable Diffusion fine-tuning, please check out the blog [Fine-tune text-to-image Stable Diffusion models with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/fine-tune-text-to-image-stable-diffusion-models-with-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/)."

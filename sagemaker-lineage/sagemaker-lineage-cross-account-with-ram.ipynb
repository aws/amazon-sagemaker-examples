    "## Amazon SageMaker Cross Account Lineage Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Lineage tracks events that happen within SageMaker allowing events be traced via a graph structure. SageMaker Lineage support queries across accounts so that lineage tracking will work with entities deployed and shared across multiple AWS accounts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cross account capability allows the association of lineage entites across multiple accounts, for example associate artifacts between training and production release accounts. The mechanism to share lineage across accounts is called a Lineage Group. To establish a sharing relationship between accounts you first create a LineageGroup (or use the default lineage group) and then use the lineage query APIs to discover relationships across the lineage graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your machine learning workflows can generate deeply nested relationships, the lineage APIs allow you to answer questions about these relationships. For example find all Data Sets that trained the model deployed to a given Endpoint or find all Models trained by a Data Set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lineage graph is created automatically by SageMaker and you can directly create or modify your own lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on Cross Account lineage tracking, visit the [SageMaker Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/lineage-tracking.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lineage Graph** - A connected graph tracing your machine learning workflow end to end. \n",
    "* **Artifacts** - Represents a URI addressable object or data.  Artifacts are typically inputs or outputs to Actions.  \n",
    "* **Actions**  - Represents an action taken such as a computation, transformation, or job.  \n",
    "* **Contexts** - Provides a method to logically group other entities.\n",
    "* **Associations** - A directed edge in the lineage graph that links two entities.\n",
    "* **Lineage Traversal** - Starting from an arbitrary point trace the lineage graph to discover and analyze relationships between steps in your workflow.\n",
    "* **Experiments** - Experiment entites (Experiments, Trials, and Trial Components) are also part of the lineage graph and can be associated wtih Artifacts, Actions, or Contexts.\n",
    "* **Cross Account Lineage** - The capability of establishing lineage associations between artifacts in different accounts.\n",
    "* **Lineage Group** - A set of lineage entities that can be shared with other accounts. Use the PutLineageGroupPolicy API to share lineage groups with other accounts. Accounts are currently limited to a single lineage group."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the bias as well as the limitations of an ML model before using it in production. To understand the ML model behavior, you need to perform a deep evaluation activity, which includes analyzing different metrics and understanding the ML model performance under different edge conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE- Note that this notebook needs to be run from a ml.c5.xlarge instance with at least 50 GB of disk space.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook shows how an ML model can be evaluated for a specific use-case. Here is a specific use-case and set of ML models that you would use as part of this notebook:\n",
    "* **Use-case** - Person counting use-case. \n",
    "* **Requirement** - An aerial camera needs to count people at a location to ensure that the location is not over-crowded. \n",
    "* **Goal** - Understand the performance of the ML model.\n",
    "* **ML Model(s) to be evaluated**:\n",
    " - [GluonCV YOLOv3 Object Detector](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5jlvp43tsn3ny?ref_=mlmp_content_yj_tw)\n",

    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: * GluonCV models are open-source and can be used outside of AWS Marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why person counting use-case?**\n",
    " In the field of computer vision, person counting use case is becoming prevalent. Real world use cases include: security camera footage analysis in high security locations such as airports, warehouse and construction, aerial footage for a big mass event, or for monitoring systems which generate alarms whenever a location has more than allotted capacity."

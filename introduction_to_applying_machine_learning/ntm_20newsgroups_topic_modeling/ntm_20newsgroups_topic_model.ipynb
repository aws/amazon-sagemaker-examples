NTM is most commonly used to discover a user-specified number of topics shared by documents within a text corpus. Here each observation is a document, the features are the presence (or occurrence count) of each word, and the categories are the topics. Since the method is unsupervised, the topics are not specified upfront and are not guaranteed to align with how a human may naturally categorize documents. The topics are learned as a probability distribution over the words that occur in each document. Each document, in turn, is described as a mixture of topics. \n", "\n", "In this notebook, we will use the Amazon SageMaker NTM algorithm to train a model on the [20NewsGroups](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups) data set. This data set has been widely used as a topic modeling benchmark. \n", "\n", "The main goals of this notebook are as follows:\n", "\n", "1. learn how to obtain and store data for use in Amazon SageMaker,\n", "2. create an AWS SageMaker training job on a data set to produce an NTM model,\n", "3. use the model to perform inference with an Amazon SageMaker endpoint.\n", "4. explore trained model and visualized learned topics\n", "\n", "If you would like to know more please check out the [SageMaker Neural Topic Model Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ntm.html).\n", "\n", "### A Brief Overview of SageMaker NTM\n", "\n", "Topic models are a classical example of probablistic graphical models that involve challenging posterior inference problems. We implement topic modeling under a neural-network based variational inference framework. The difficult inference problem is framed as an optimization problem solved by scalable methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Compared to conventional inference schemes, the neural-network implementation allows for scalable model training as well as low-latency inference. Furthermore, the flexibility of the neural inference framework allows us to more quickly add new functionalities and serve a wider range of customer use cases.\n", "\n", "The high-level diagram of SageMaker NTM is shown below:\n", "\n", "<img src=\"ntm_diagram.png\" width=\"600\">\n", "\n", "$$\n", "\\begin{equation}\n", "\\begin{split}\n", "\\textrm{Encoder} \\ q(z\\vert x): & \\\\\n", "& \\pi = f_X^{MLP}(x), \\quad \\mu(x) = l_1(\\pi), \\quad \\log \\sigma(x) = l_2(\\pi)\\\\\n", "& h(x, \\epsilon) = \\mu + \\sigma \\epsilon, \\ \\textrm{where} \\ \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,I),\\quad z=g(h), \\ \\textrm{where} \\ h \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2 I) \\\\\n", "\\textrm{Decoder} \\ p(x\\vert z): & \\\\\n", "& y(z) = \\textrm{softmax}(Wz+b), \\quad \\log p(x\\vert z) = \\sum x \\odot \\log(y(z))\n", "\\end{split}\n", "\\end{equation}\n", "$$\n", "\n", "where $l_1$ and $l_2$ are linear transformations with bias.\n", "\n", "### Beyond Text Data\n", "\n", "In principle, topic models can be applied to types of data beyond text documents.

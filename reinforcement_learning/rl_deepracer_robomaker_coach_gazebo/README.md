# DeepRacer notebook using Amazon SageMaker RL and AWS RoboMaker services

This folder contains examples of how to use RL to train an autonomous deepracer. This is a jailbreaker for the AWS DeepRacer. This gives a glimse of architecture used to get the DeepRacer working.


## Contents

* `deepracer_rl.ipynb`: notebook for training autonomous race car.

* `Dockerfile`: Custom docker instead of using SageMaker default docker

* `src/`
  * `training_worker.py`: Main entrypoint for starting distributed training job
  * `markov/`: Helper files for S3 upload/download
   * `presets/default.py`: Preset (configuration) for DeepRacer
   * `rewards/default.py`: Custom reward function
   * `environments/deepracer_racetrack_env.py`: Gym environment file for DeepRacer
   * `actions/model_metadata_10_state.json`: JSON file to customize your action space & the speed
  * `lib/`: redis configuration file and ppo_head.py customized tensorflow file copied to sagemaker container.

* `common/`: helper function to build docker files.

## How to use the notebook

1. Login to your AWS account - SageMaker service ([SageMaker Link](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=us-west-2#/dashboard))
2. On the left tab select `Notebook instances`
3. Select `Create notebook instance`
4. Fill up the notebook instance name. In the Additional configuration select atleast 25GB. This is because docker gets installed and takes up space.
5. Create a new IAM role. Give root permission
6. Select the git repository and clone this repository.
7. Then click create notebook instance button at the button
8. This takes like 2 min to create your notebook instance. Then click on the newly created instance and click on the juypter notebook.
9. You will see all the github files and now run `deepracer_rl.ipynb`
10. Run clean robomaker & sagemaker commands in the script only when you are done with training.

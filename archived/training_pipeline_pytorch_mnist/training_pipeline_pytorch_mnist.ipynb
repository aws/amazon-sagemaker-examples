    "\n",
    "**If you are running this notebook on an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance**, the IAM role assumed by your notebook instance needs permission to create and run workflows in AWS Step Functions. To provide this permission to the role, do the following.\n",

    "1. Open the Amazon [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). \n",
    "2. Select **Notebook instances** and choose the name of your notebook instance\n",
    "3. Under **Permissions and encryption** select the role ARN to view the role on the IAM console\n",
    "4. Choose **Attach policies** and search for `AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess`.\n",
    "5. Select the check box next to `AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess` and choose **Attach policy**\n",

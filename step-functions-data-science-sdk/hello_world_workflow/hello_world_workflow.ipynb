    "### Add a policy to your SageMaker role in IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are running this notebook on an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance**, the IAM role assumed by your notebook instance needs permission to create and run workflows in AWS Step Functions. To provide this permission to the role, do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Amazon [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). \n",
    "2. Select **Notebook instances** and choose the name of your notebook instance\n",
    "3. Under **Permissions and encryption** select the role ARN to view the role on the IAM console\n",
    "4. Choose **Attach policies** and search for `AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess`.\n",
    "5. Select the check box next to `AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess` and choose **Attach policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running this notebook in a local environment, the SDK will use your configured AWS CLI configuration. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).\n",

    "Next, create an execution role in IAM for Step Functions. \n",

    "### Create an execution role for Step Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You need an execution role so that you can create and execute workflows in Step Functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\n",
    "2. Select **Roles** and then **Create role**.\n",
    "3. Under **Choose the service that will use this role** select **Step Functions**\n",
    "4. Choose **Next** until you can enter a **Role name**\n",
    "5. Enter a name such as `StepFunctionsWorkflowExecutionRole` and then select **Create role**\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This workflow highlights the capability to blend together customer provided item-metadata along with quantile forecasts from backtesting periods to determine the quantile likely to generate the most amount of profit in future periods, all other things in the world being the same.  A sample, fictitious dataset and a flow file are provided to help demonstrate the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required input data: time-series backtest predictions\n",
    "This set of data would be produced by your time-series forecaster. In this case, this sample file structure was produced by Amazon Forecast, landing data on Amazon S3.  An important note is this is data held out from training data.  Models are trained on data that predates the `backtestwindow_start_time`. Out-of-sample predictions enable various quantiles to be expressed next to the known target values.\n",
    "\n",

    "| `target_value`* | known, actual true value from held back history training data   \n",

    "`*` Conceptually, a required field\n",
    "`**` You should have 2 or more quantiles in your data. In this example five are shown, but the range of values and quantity should be of your choosing.  More quantiles enable more points to examine where the profitability curve meets its apex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required input data: customer provided financial metadata file\n",
    "This set of data is meant to illustrate capability and is placed on S3 for purposes of this demonstration. Customers may elect to alter this structure, making it more or less complex according to need. Additionally, customers may elect to store the data in a database as opposed to S3.  Amazon Data Wrangler has an ability to source data from a myriad of source databases and more than 40 other SaaS endpoints, when needed.\n",

    "| `item_holding_cost` | for unsold items, this cost represents the annualized cost of warehouse, storage, handling to carry the item in inventory\n",
    "| `item_salvage_cost` | Salvage cost represents the value of the item if unsold. If the product spoils, salvage cost may be zero.  If the item is shelf-stable, salvage cost might represent a clearance/final sale amount. Range of values should be from a low of `0` to a high of `item_value`\n",

    "1. Download the following Data Wrangler flow file to your laptop. You can also `git clone` to obtain the file, if you prefer. In a next step, you will upload this file to your SageMaker Studio environment.\n",

    "In the Data Wrangler flow, you will see a transform labeled `filter to last N-periods`.  Double-click the transform to edit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As delivered, this transform will compare the timestamp in the input forecast file against \"today\" and remove any observations prior to 36 months ago.  You can wholly remove this step, or edit the time-period according to your use case.  If you filter the data to very recent periods only, then quantile selection will be more sensitive to recent periods.  Allowing a wider range takes a more holistic view, including viewing prior season.  Apply discretion here to make the best decision for your specific case.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this step can be used to filter backtest data to only a recent period when desired\n",

    "As with the prior transform, you may decide to edit the quantile computation logic.  This is located in a transform titled `compute-quantile-financial`.

In this section, the goal is to add S3 destinations, which ultimately, will write data to your own S3 bucket.

You may not need the quantile based output files and can delete these, if appropriate.

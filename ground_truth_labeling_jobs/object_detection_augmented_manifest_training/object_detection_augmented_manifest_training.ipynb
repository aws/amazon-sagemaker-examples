    "Augmented manifests provide two key benefits. First, the format is consistent with that of a labeling job output manifest. This means that you can take your output manifests from a Ground Truth labeling job and, whether the dataset objects were entirely human-labeled, entirely machine-labeled, or anything in between, and use them as inputs to SageMaker training jobs - all without any additional translation or reformatting! Second, the dataset objects and their corresponding ground truth labels/annotations are captured *inline*. This effectively reduces the required number of channels by half, since you no longer need one channel for the dataset objects alone and another for the associated ground truth labels/annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The augmented manifest format is essentially the [json-lines format](http://jsonlines.org/), also called the new-line delimited JSON format. This format consists of an arbitrary number of well-formed, fully-defined JSON objects, each on a separate line. Augmented manifests must contain a field that defines a dataset object, and a field that defines the corresponding annotation. Let's look at an example for an object detection problem.\n",

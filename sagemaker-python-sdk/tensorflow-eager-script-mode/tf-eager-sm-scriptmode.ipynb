    "# TensorFlow Eager Execution with Amazon SageMaker Script Mode and Automatic Model Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with TensorFlow version 1.11, you can use SageMaker's prebuilt TensorFlow containers with TensorFlow training scripts similar to those you would use outside SageMaker. This feature is named Script Mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use Script Mode in conjunction with TensorFlow's Eager Execution mode, which is the default execution mode of TensorFlow 2 onwards.  Eager execution is an imperative interface where operations are executed immediately, rather than building a static computational graph. Advantages of Eager Execution include a more intuitive interface with natural Python control flow and less boilerplate, easier debugging, and support for dynamic models and almost all of the available TensorFlow operations. It also features close integration with tf.keras to make rapid prototyping even easier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate Script Mode, this notebook focuses on presenting a relatively complete workflow. The workflow includes local training and hosted training in SageMaker, as well as local inference and SageMaker hosted inference with a real time endpoint. Additionally, Automatic Model Tuning in SageMaker will be used to tune the model's hyperparameters.  This workflow will be applied to a straightforward regression task, predicting house prices based on the well-known Boston Housing dataset. More specifically, this public dataset contains 13 features regarding housing stock of towns in the Boston area, including features such as average number of rooms, accessibility to radial highways, adjacency to the Charles River, etc.  \n",

By calling the `deploy` method of the HyperparameterTuner object we instantiated above, we can directly deploy the best model from the tuning job to a SageMaker hosted endpoint:\n",

These are likely to be central elements for most deep learning workflows in SageMaker.  "

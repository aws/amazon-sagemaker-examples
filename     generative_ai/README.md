# Amazon SageMaker Examples

### Generative AI

These examples showcases Amazon SageMaker's capabilities in the exciting field of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI models are designed to create new, synthetic data across various modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video, based on the patterns and relationships learned from training data.

- [Data Distribution Types](data_distribution_types) showcases the difference between two methods for sending data from S3 to Amazon SageMaker Training instances.  This has particular implication for scalability and accuracy of distributed training.
- [Distributed Training and Batch Transform with Sentiment Classification](sentiment_parallel_batch) shows how to use SageMaker Distributed Data Parallelism, SageMaker Debugger, and distrubted SageMaker Batch Transform on a HuggingFace Estimator, in a sentiment classification use case.

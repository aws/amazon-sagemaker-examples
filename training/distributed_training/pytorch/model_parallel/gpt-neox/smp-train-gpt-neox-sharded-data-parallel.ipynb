    "In this notebook, you learn how to train or fine-tune the Hugging Face Transformers [GPT-NeoX-20B](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt_neox) model with the [Sharded Data Parallelism](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-sharded-data-parallelism.html) technique in [SageMaker's Model Parallelism library (SMP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel.html) with PyTorch 1.13 and [GLUE/SST2 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue/viewer/sst2/train) on SageMaker. \n",

    "Sharded data parallelism is a distributed training technique that splits the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across GPUs in a data parallel group. It is purpose-built for extreme-scale models and leverages Amazon in-house [MiCS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00119.pdf) technology which achieves a near-linear scaling efficiency. For large models that cannot fit into a single GPU, we recommend to use the sharded data parallelism technique with [Activation Checkpointing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-checkpointing.html) and [Activation Offloading](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-offloading.html) in SMP first, before leveraging other techniques such as tensor parallelism or pipeline parallelism.\n",

You can follow the comments throughout the script to learn where the SMP APIs and code modifications are implemented.\n",

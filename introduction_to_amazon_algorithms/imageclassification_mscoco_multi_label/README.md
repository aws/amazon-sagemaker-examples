### SageMaker Image classification multi-label training
This notebook `Imageclassification-multilabel-lst.ipynb` demos an end-2-end system for image classification training on multi-label datasets using image and list files. MSCOCO dataset is used to create a multi-label dataset using the first 5 categories. It shows how the lst file can be generated for multi-label datasets and used for training. The network re-initializes the fully-connected layer and retrains the layer while at the same time fine-tuning the other layers. The network shows the use of multi_label parameter as well as the use_weighted_loss parameter. Various other parameters such as network depth (number of layers), batch_size, learning_rate, etc., can be varied in the training. Once the training is complete, the notebook shows how to host the trained model for inference.

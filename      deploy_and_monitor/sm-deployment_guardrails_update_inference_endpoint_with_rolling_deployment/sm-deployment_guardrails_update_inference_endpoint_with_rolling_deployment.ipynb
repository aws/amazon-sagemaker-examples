    "Deployment guardrails are a set of model deployment options in Amazon SageMaker Inference to update your machine learning models in production. Using the fully managed deployment guardrails options, you can control the switch from the current model in production to a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you update your endpoint, you can specify a rolling deployment to gradually shift traffic from your old fleet to a new fleet. You can control the size of the traffic shifting steps, as well as specify an evaluation period to monitor the new instances for issues before terminating instances from the old fleet. With rolling deployments, instances on the old fleet are cleaned up after each traffic shift to the new fleet, reducing the amount of additional instances needed to update your endpoint. This is useful especially for accelerated instances that are in high demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling deployments work similarly to the linear traffic shifting mode in blue/green deployments, but rolling deployments provide you with the added benefit fewer capacity needs. Compared to blue/green deployments with canary or linear traffic shifting modes, rolling deployments can also have lower costs. With rolling deployments, fewer instances are active at a time, and you have more granular control over how many instances you want to update in the new fleet. You should consider using a rolling deployment instead of a blue/green deployment if you have large models or a large endpoint with many instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following list describes the key features of rolling deployments in SageMaker:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Baking period**. The baking period is a set amount of time to monitor the new fleet before proceeding to the next deployment stage. If any of the pre-specified alarms trip during any baking period, then all endpoint traffic rolls back to the old fleet. The baking period helps you to build confidence in your update before making the traffic shift permanent.\n",
    "* **Rolling batch size**. You have granular control over the size of each batch for traffic shifting, or the number of instances you want to update in each batch. This number can range for 5-50% of the size of your fleet. You can specify the batch size as a number of instances or as the overall percentage of your fleet.\n",
    "* **Auto-rollbacks**. You can specify Amazon CloudWatch alarms that SageMaker uses to monitor the new fleet. If an issue with the updated code trips any of the alarms, SageMaker initiates an auto-rollback to the old fleet in order to maintain availability, thereby minimizing risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll update endpoint with following deployment configurations:\n",
    " * Rolling update policy\n",
    " * Configure CloudWatch alarms to monitor model performance and trigger auto-rollback action.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To demonstrate rolling deployments and the auto-rollback feature, we will update an Endpoint with an incompatible model version and deploy it as a Rolling fleet, taking a small percentage of the traffic. Requests sent to this Rolling fleet will result in errors, which will be used to trigger a rollback using pre-specified CloudWatch alarms. Finally, we will also demonstrate a success scenario where no alarms are tripped and the update succeeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is organized in 4 steps -\n",
    "* Step 1 creates the models and Endpoint Configurations required for the 3 scenarios - the baseline, the update containing the incompatible model version and the update containing the correct model version. \n",
    "* Step 2 invokes the baseline Endpoint prior to the update. \n",
    "* Step 3 specifies the CloudWatch alarms used to trigger the rollbacks. \n",
    "* Finally in step 4, we update the endpoint to trigger a rollback and demonstrate a successful update. "

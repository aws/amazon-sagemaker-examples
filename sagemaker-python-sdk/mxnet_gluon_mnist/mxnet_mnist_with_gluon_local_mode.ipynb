    "This notebook shows how to use the SageMaker Python SDK to run your code in a local container before deploying to SageMaker's managed training or hosting environments.  This can speed up iterative testing and debugging while using the same familiar Python SDK interface.  Just change your estimator's `train_instance_type` to `local`.  You could also use `local_gpu` if you're using an ml.p2 or ml.p3 notebook instance, but then you'll need to set `train_instance_count=1` since distributed, local, GPU training is not yet supported.\n",

    "MNIST is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). This tutorial will show how to train and test an MNIST model on SageMaker local mode using MXNet and the Gluon API."

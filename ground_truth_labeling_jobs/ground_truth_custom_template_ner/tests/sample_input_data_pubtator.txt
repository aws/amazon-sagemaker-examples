25605870|a|NLRP3 is the most crucial member of the NLR family, as it detects the existence of pathogen invasion and self-derived molecules associated with cellular damage. Several studies have reported that excessive NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation is a key factor in the development of diseases. Recent studies have reported that Syk is involved in pathogen-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation; however, the detailed mechanism linking Syk to NLRP3 inflammasome remains unclear. In this study, we showed that Syk mediates NLRP3 stimuli-induced processing of procaspase-1 and the consequent activation of caspase-1. Moreover, the kinase activity of Syk is required to potentiate caspase-1 activation in a reconstituted NLRP3 inflammasome system in HEK293T cells. The adaptor protein ASC bridges NLRP3 with the effector protein caspase-1. Herein, we find that Syk can associate directly with ASC and NLRP3 by its kinase domain but interact indirectly with procaspase-1. Syk can phosphorylate ASC at Y146 and Y187 residues, and the phosphorylation of both residues is critical to enhance ASC oligomerization and the recruitment of procaspase-1. Together, our results reveal a new molecular pathway through which Syk promotes NLRP3 inflammasome formation, resulting from the phosphorylation of ASC. Thus, the control of Syk activity might be effective to modulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and treat NLRP3-related immune diseases.

25500533|a|LRRK2, a gene relevant to Parkinson's disease, encodes a scaffolding protein with both GTPase and kinase activities. LRRK2 protein is itself phosphorylated and therefore is subject to regulation by cell signalling; however, the kinase(s) responsible for this event have not been definitively identified. Here using an unbiased siRNA kinome screen, we identify and validate casein kinase 1α (CK1α) as being responsible for LRRK2 phosphorylation, including in the adult mouse striatum. We further show that LRRK2 recruitment to TGN46-positive Golgi-derived vesicles is modulated by constitutive LRRK2 phosphorylation by CK1α. These effects are mediated by differential protein interactions of LRRK2 with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, ARHGEF7. These pathways are therefore likely involved in the physiological maintenance of the Golgi in cells, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 

22582013|a|Protein phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism regulating nearly every aspect of cellular life. Several secreted proteins are phosphorylated, but the kinases responsible are unknown. We identified a family of atypical protein kinases that localize within the Golgi apparatus and are secreted. Fam20C appears to be the Golgi casein kinase that phosphorylates secretory pathway proteins within S-x-E motifs. Fam20C phosphorylates the caseins and several secreted proteins implicated in biomineralization, including the small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoproteins (SIBLINGs). Consequently, mutations in Fam20C cause an osteosclerotic bone dysplasia in humans known as Raine syndrome. Fam20C is thus a protein kinase dedicated to the phosphorylation of extracellular proteins.

20856200|a|The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is aberrant in a wide variety of cancers. Downstream effectors of AKT are involved in survival, growth and metabolic-related pathways. In contrast, contradictory data relating to AKT effects on cell motility and invasion, crucial prometastatic processes, have been reported pointing to a potential cell type and isoform type-specific AKT-driven function. By implication, study of AKT signaling should optimally be conducted in an appropriate intracellular environment. Prognosis in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS), the aggressive malignancies of mesenchymal origin, is poor, reflecting our modest ability to control metastasis, an effort hampered by lack of insight into molecular mechanisms driving STS progression and dissemination. We examined the impact of the cancer progression-relevant AKT pathway on the mesenchymal tumor cell internal milieu. We demonstrate that AKT1 activation induces STS cell motility and invasiveness at least partially through a novel interaction with the intermediate filament vimentin (Vim). The binding of AKT (tail region) to Vim (head region) results in Vim Ser39 phosphorylation enhancing the ability of Vim to induce motility and invasion while protecting Vim from caspase-induced proteolysis. Moreover, vimentin phosphorylation was shown to enhance tumor and metastasis growth in vivo. Insights into this mesenchymal-related molecular mechanism may facilitate the development of critically lacking therapeutic options for these devastating malignancies.

20890306|a|Phosphorylation of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein sensitizes cancer cells to various chemotherapeutics. However, the molecular mechanism underlying chemosensitization by phosphorylated FADD (P-FADD) is poorly understood. In this study, we describe the physical interactions and functional interplay between Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and FADD. Plk1 phosphorylates FADD at Ser-194 in response to treatment with taxol. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, FADD S194D, caused degradation of Plk1 in an ubiquitin-independent manner, and delayed cytokinesis, consistent with the expected cellular phenotype of Plk1 deficiency. This demonstrates that Plk1 is regulated via a negative feedback loop by its substrate, FADD. Overexpression of FADD S194D sensitized HeLa cells to a low dose of taxol independently of caspase activation, whereas overexpression of FADD S194D resulted in caspase activation in response to a high dose of taxol. Therefore, we examined whether the death potential of P-FADD affected Plk1-mediated tumorigenesis. Transfection of FADD S194D inhibited colony formation by Plk1-overexpressing HeLa cells (HeLa-Plk1). Moreover, overexpression of FADD S194D suppressed tumorigenesis in nude mice xenografted with HeLa-Plk1. Therefore, this study reports the first in vivo validation of tumor-suppressing activity of P-FADD. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in response to taxol, Plk1 endows death-promoting and tumor-suppressor functions to its substrate, FADD.

20861839|a|Symplekin (Pta1 in yeast) is a scaffold in the large protein complex that is required for 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation of eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs); it also participates in transcription initiation and termination by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Symplekin mediates interactions between many different proteins in this machinery, although the molecular basis for its function is not known. Here we report the crystal structure at 2.4 Å resolution of the amino-terminal domain (residues 30-340) of human symplekin in a ternary complex with the Pol II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) Ser 5 phosphatase Ssu72 (refs 7, 10-17) and a CTD Ser 5 phosphopeptide. The N-terminal domain of symplekin has the ARM or HEAT fold, with seven pairs of antiparallel α-helices arranged in the shape of an arc. The structure of Ssu72 has some similarity to that of low-molecular-mass phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase, although Ssu72 has a unique active-site landscape as well as extra structural features at the C terminus that are important for interaction with symplekin. Ssu72 is bound to the concave face of symplekin, and engineered mutations in this interface can abolish interactions between the two proteins. The CTD peptide is bound in the active site of Ssu72, with the pSer 5-Pro 6 peptide bond in the cis configuration, which contrasts with all other known CTD peptide conformations. Although the active site of Ssu72 is about 25 Å from the interface with symplekin, we found that the symplekin N-terminal domain stimulates Ssu72 CTD phosphatase activity in vitro. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain of symplekin inhibits polyadenylation in vitro, but only when coupled to transcription. Because catalytically active Ssu72 overcomes this inhibition, our results show a role for mammalian Ssu72 in transcription-coupled pre-mRNA 3'-end processing.

20668449|a|The post-translational methylation of alpha-amino groups was first discovered over 30 years ago on the bacterial ribosomal proteins L16 and L33 (refs 1, 2), but almost nothing is known about the function or enzymology of this modification. Several other bacterial and eukaryotic proteins have since been shown to be alpha-N-methylated. However, the Ran guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, RCC1, is the only protein for which any biological function of alpha-N-methylation has been identified. Methylation-defective mutants of RCC1 have reduced affinity for DNA and cause mitotic defects, but further characterization of this modification has been hindered by ignorance of the responsible methyltransferase. All fungal and animal N-terminally methylated proteins contain a unique N-terminal motif, Met-(Ala/Pro/Ser)-Pro-Lys, indicating that they may be targets of the same, unknown enzyme. The initiating Met is cleaved, and the exposed alpha-amino group is mono-, di- or trimethylated. Here we report the discovery of the first alpha-N-methyltransferase, which we named N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase (NRMT). Substrate docking and mutational analysis of RCC1 defined the NRMT recognition sequence and enabled the identification of numerous new methylation targets, including SET (also known as TAF-I or PHAPII) and the retinoblastoma protein, RB. Knockdown of NRMT recapitulates the multi-spindle phenotype seen with methylation-defective RCC1 mutants, demonstrating the importance of alpha-N-methylation for normal bipolar spindle formation and chromosome segregation.

20637424|a|Crystal structures of inactive PAK1(K299R) and the activation (A)-loop phospho-mimetic PAK1(T423E) have suggested that the kinase domain is in an active state regardless of activation loop status. Contrary to a large body of literature, we find that neither is PAK1(T423E) active in cells, nor does it exhibit significant activity in vitro. To explain these discrepancies all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of PAK1(phospho-T423) in complex with ATP and substrate were performed. These simulations point to a key interaction between PAK1 Lys308, at the end of the alphaC helix, and the pThr423 phosphate group, not seen in X-ray structures. The orthologous PAK4 Arg359 fulfills the same role in immobilizing the alphaC helix. These in silico predictions were validated by experimental mutagenesis of PAK1 and PAK4. The simulations explain why the PAK1 A-loop phospho-mimetic is inactive, but also point to a key functional interaction likely found in other protein kinases.

20642453|a|LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2) is mutated in a significant number of Parkinson's disease patients, but still little is understood about how it is regulated or functions. In the present study we have demonstrated that 14-3-3 protein isoforms interact with LRRK2. Consistent with this, endogenous LRRK2 isolated from Swiss 3T3 cells or various mouse tissues is associated with endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms. We have established that 14-3-3 binding is mediated by phosphorylation of LRRK2 at two conserved residues (Ser910 and Ser935) located before the leucine-rich repeat domain. Our results suggests that mutation of Ser910 and/or Ser935 to disrupt 14-3-3 binding does not affect intrinsic protein kinase activity, but induces LRRK2 to accumulate within discrete cytoplasmic pools, perhaps resembling inclusion bodies. To investigate links between 14-3-3 binding and Parkinson's disease, we studied how 41 reported mutations of LRRK2 affected 14-3-3 binding and cellular localization. Strikingly, we found that five of the six most common pathogenic mutations (R1441C, R1441G, R1441H, Y1699C and I2020T) display markedly reduced phosphorylation of Ser910/Ser935 thereby disrupting interaction with 14-3-3. We have also demonstrated that Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding to endogenous LRRK2 is significantly reduced in tissues of homozygous LRRK2(R1441C) knock-in mice. Consistent with 14-3-3 regulating localization, all of the common pathogenic mutations displaying reduced 14-3-3-binding accumulated within inclusion bodies. We also found that three of the 41 LRRK2 mutations analysed displayed elevated protein kinase activity (R1728H, ~2-fold; G2019S, ~3-fold; and T2031S, ~4-fold). These results provide the first evidence suggesting that 14-3-3 regulates LRRK2 and that disruption of the interaction of LRRK2 with 14-3-3 may be linked to Parkinson's disease.

20708156|a|Mdm2 is the major negative regulator of the p53 pathway. Here, we report that Mdm2 is rapidly degraded after DNA damage and that phosphorylation of Mdm2 by casein kinase I (CKI) at multiple sites triggers its interaction with, and subsequent ubiquitination and destruction, by SCF(beta-TRCP). Inactivation of either beta-TRCP or CKI results in accumulation of Mdm2 and decreased p53 activity, and resistance to apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents. Moreover, SCF(beta-TRCP)-dependent Mdm2 turnover also contributes to the control of repeated p53 pulses in response to persistent DNA damage. Our results provide insight into the signaling pathways controlling Mdm2 destruction and further suggest that compromised regulation of Mdm2 results in attenuated p53 activity, thereby facilitating tumor progression.

20659021|a|LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2) is mutated in a significant number of Parkinson's disease patients. Since a common mutation that replaces Gly2019 with a serine residue enhances kinase catalytic activity, small-molecule LRRK2 inhibitors might have utility in treating Parkinson's disease. However, the effectiveness of inhibitors is difficult to assess, as no physiological substrates or downstream effectors have been identified that could be exploited to develop a robust cell-based assay. We recently established that LRRK2 bound 14-3-3 protein isoforms via its phosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935. In the present study we show that treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells or lymphoblastoid cells derived from control or a Parkinson's disease patient harbouring a homozygous LRRK2(G2019S) mutation with two structurally unrelated inhibitors of LRRK2 (H-1152 or sunitinib) induced dephosphorylation of endogenous LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935, thereby disrupting 14-3-3 interaction. Our results suggest that H-1152 and sunitinib induce dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 by inhibiting LRRK2 kinase activity, as these compounds failed to induce significant dephosphorylation of a drug-resistant LRRK2(A2016T) mutant. Moreover, consistent with the finding that non-14-3-3-binding mutants of LRRK2 accumulated within discrete cytoplasmic pools resembling inclusion bodies, we observed that H-1152 causes LRRK2 to accumulate within inclusion bodies. These findings indicate that dephosphorylation of Ser910/Ser935, disruption of 14-3-3 binding and/or monitoring LRRK2 cytoplasmic localization can be used as an assay to assess the relative activity of LRRK2 inhibitors in vivo. These results will aid the elaboration and evaluation of LRRK2 inhibitors. They will also stimulate further research to understand how phosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 is controlled by LRRK2, and establish any relationship to development of Parkinson's disease.

20708153|a|Regulators of mitosis have been successfully targeted to enhance response to taxane chemotherapy. Here, we show that the salt inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) localizes at the centrosome, plays a key role in the initiation of mitosis, and regulates the localization of the centrosome linker protein, C-Nap1, through S2392 phosphorylation. Interference with the known SIK2 inhibitor PKA induced SIK2-dependent centrosome splitting in interphase while SIK2 depletion blocked centrosome separation in mitosis, sensitizing ovarian cancers to paclitaxel in culture and in xenografts. Depletion of SIK2 also delayed G1/S transition and reduced AKT phosphorylation. Higher expression of SIK2 significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancers. We believe these data identify SIK2 as a plausible target for therapy in ovarian cancers.

20705607|a|The related RING domain proteins MdmX and Mdm2 are best known for their role as negative regulators of the tumor suppressor p53. However, although Mdm2 functions as a ubiquitin ligase for p53, MdmX does not have appreciable ubiquitin ligase activity. In this study, we performed a mutational analysis of the RING domain of MdmX, and we identified two distinct regions that, when replaced by the respective regions of Mdm2, turn MdmX into an active ubiquitin ligase for p53. Mdm2 and MdmX form homodimers as well as heterodimers with each other. One of the regions identified localizes to the dimer interface indicating that subtle conformational changes in this region either affect dimer stability and/or the interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5b. The second region contains the cryptic nucleolar localization signal of Mdm2 but is also assumed to be involved in the interaction with UbcH5b. Here, we show that this region has a significant impact on the ability of respective MdmX mutants to functionally interact with UbcH5b in vitro supporting the notion that this region serves two distinct functional purposes, nucleolar localization and ubiquitin ligase activity. Finally, evidence is provided to suggest that the RING domain of Mdm2 not only binds to UbcH5b but also acts as an allosteric activator of UbcH5b.

20832753|a|BMK1 is activated by mitogens and oncogenic signals and, thus, is strongly implicated in tumorigenesis. We found that BMK1 interacted with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), and inhibited its tumor-suppressor function through phosphorylation. Furthermore, activated BMK1 notably inhibited PML-dependent activation of p21. To further investigate the BMK-mediated inhibition of the tumor suppressor activity of PML in tumor cells, we developed a small-molecule inhibitor of the kinase activity of BMK1, XMD8-92. Inhibition of BMK1 by XMD8-92 blocked tumor cell proliferation in vitro and significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo by 95%, demonstrating the efficacy and tolerability of BMK1-targeted cancer treatment in animals.

18922877|a|The central role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in activating host immune responses stems from their high capacity to express alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) after stimulation of Toll-like receptors 7 and 9 (TLR7 and -9). This involves the adapter MyD88 and the kinases interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), IRAK4, and IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha), which activates IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and is independent of the canonical kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon. We have recently shown that the immunosuppressive measles virus (MV) abolishes TLR7/9/MyD88-dependent IFN induction in human pDC (Schlender et al., J. Virol. 79:5507-5515, 2005), but the molecular mechanisms remained elusive. Here, we have reconstituted the pathway in cell lines and identified IKKalpha and IRF7 as specific targets of the MV V protein (MV-V). Binding of MV-V to IKKalpha resulted in phosphorylation of V on the expense of IRF7 phosphorylation by IKKalpha in vitro and in living cells. This corroborates the role of IKKalpha as the kinase phosphorylating IRF7. MV-V in addition bound to IRF7 and to phosphomimetic IRF7 and inhibited IRF7 transcriptional activity. Binding to both IKKalpha and IRF7 required the 68-amino-acid unique C-terminal domain of V. Inhibition of TLR/MyD88-dependent IFN induction by MV-V is unique among paramyxovirus V proteins and should contribute to the unique immunosuppressive phenotype of measles. The mechanisms employed by MV-V inspire strategies to interfere with immunopathological TLR/MyD88 signaling.

16840345|a|Viruses have to adjust to the host cell to guarantee their life cycle and survival. This aspect of the virus-host cell interaction is probably performed by viral proteins, such as serine-threonine kinases, that are present early during infection. Vaccinia virus has an early Ser-Thr kinase, B1R, which, although required for successful viral infection, is poorly characterized regarding its effects on cellular proteins, and thus, its potential contribution to pathogenesis is not known. Signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is mediated by the assembly of complexes between these kinases and the JIP scaffold proteins. To understand how vaccinia virus B1R can affect the host, its roles in the cellular signaling by MAPK complexes and c-Jun activation have been studied. Independently of its kinase activity, B1R can interact with the central region of the JIP1 scaffold protein. The B1R-JIP1 complex increases the amount of MAPK bound to JIP1; thus, MKK7 and TAK1 either bind with higher affinity or bind more stably to JIP1, while there is an increase in the phosphorylation state of JNK bound to JIP1. The functional consequence of these more stable interactions is an increase in the activity of transcription factors, such as c-Jun, that respond to these complexes. Furthermore, B1R is also able to directly phosphorylate c-Jun in residues different from those targeted by JNK and, thus, B1R can also cooperate by an independent route in c-Jun activation. Vaccinia virus B1R can thus modulate the signaling of pathways that respond to cellular stress.

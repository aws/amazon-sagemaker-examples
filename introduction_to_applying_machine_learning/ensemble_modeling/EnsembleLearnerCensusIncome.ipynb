    "## Background\n",
    "Quite often, in pratical applications of Machine-Learning on predictive tasks, one model doesn't suffice. Most of the prediction competitions typically require combining forecasts from multiple sources to get an improved forecast. By combining or averaging predictions from multiple sources/models we typically get an improved forecast. This happens as there is considerable uncertainty in the choice of the model and there is no one true model in many practical applications. It is therefore beneficial to combine predictions from different models. In the Bayesian literature, this idea is referred as Bayesian Model Averaging http://www.stat.colostate.edu/~jah/papers/statsci.pdf and has been shown to work much better than just picking one model.\n",

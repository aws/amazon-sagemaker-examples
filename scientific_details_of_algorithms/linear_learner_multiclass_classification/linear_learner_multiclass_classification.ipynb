    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service for scalable training and hosting of machine learning models. We're adding multiclass classification support to the linear learner algorithm in Amazon SageMaker. Linear learner already provides convenient APIs for linear models such as logistic regression for ad click prediction, fraud detection, or other classification problems, and linear regression for forecasting sales, predicting delivery times, or other problems where you want to predict a numerical value. If you haven't worked with linear learner before, you might want to start with the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html) or our previous [example notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/scientific_details_of_algorithms/linear_learner_class_weights_loss_functions/linear_learner_class_weights_loss_functions.ipynb) on this algorithm.

Amazon SageMaker algorithms expect the `dtype` of all feature and label values to be `float32`. Also note that we shuffled the order of examples in the training set. We used the `train_test_split` method from `numpy`, which shuffles the rows by default. That's important for algorithms trained using stochastic gradient descent. Linear learner, as well as most deep learning algorithms, use stochastic gradient descent for optimization.

The generic Python SDK estimator offers some more control options, but the high-level estimator is more succinct and has some advantages. One is that we don't need to specify the location of the algorithm container we want to use for training. It will pick up the latest version of the linear learner algorithm. Another advantage is that some code errors will be surfaced before a training cluster is spun up, rather than after. For example, if we try to pass `n_classes=7` instead of the correct `num_classes=7`, then the high-level estimator will fail immediately, but the generic Python SDK estimator will spin up a cluster before failing."

    "But remember that the confusion matrix has each row normalized to sum to 1. Visually, we've given each class equal weight in our diagnostic tool. That emphasizes the gains we've made in rare classes, but it de-emphasizes the price we'll pay in terms of predicting more common classes. Recall for the most common class, Lodgepole Pine, has gone from 81% to 52%. For that reason, overall accuracy also decreased from 72% to 59%. To decide whether to use balanced class weights for your application, consider the business impact of making errors in common cases and how it compares to the impact of making errors in rare cases."

    "In this example notebook, we introduced the new multiclass classification feature of the Amazon SageMaker linear learner algorithm. We showed how to fit a multiclass model using the convenient high-level estimator API, and how to evaluate and interpret model metrics. We also showed how to achieve higher recall for rare classes using linear learner's automatic class weights calculation. Try Amazon SageMaker and linear learner on your classification problems today!"

    "# IAM Role\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will go over IAM Roles and set up a role that you will use in throughout notebooks found in '/sagemaker-fundamentals'. An IAM role is an identity associated with your AWS account that has pre-configured permission policies that determine what this role can do and with respect to your AWS resources. For example, you can define a role that can do *everything* to your S3 resource but nothing else. Such a role is useful if it is *assumed* by a program that synchronize your data from your local machine to an S3 bucket. You can be certain that this program would not accidently create EC2 instances that incur higher costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM Roles are used to grant permissions to AWS services to procure resources on your behalf. When you use an AWS service(e.g. SageMaker), you can define a role that the service can assume on your behalf to access the AWS resources. For example, SageMaker service needs to access S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Elastic Container Registries etc. To avoid incurring too much compute cost, you can define a role that is able to create only low cost EC2 instances. When SageMaker assumes this role and runs your ML workflow, you can estimate the upper bound of the compute cost based on the EC2 policy of the role. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more extensive readings on IAM role, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-role-chaining)"

    "1. If you are running this notebook from an EC2 instance, then you need to make sure `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable is set to `default`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you are running this notebook on your local machine, you will need to install and configure aws command line interface. Follow [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "I do not recommend to run it on an SageMaker Notebook Instance or Studio, because the role you used to spin up them is intended to be the same one to pass to SageMaker service for model training and hosting and the purpose of this notebook is to showcase how you can create an IAM role as an IAM user via AWS Python SDK (boto3).

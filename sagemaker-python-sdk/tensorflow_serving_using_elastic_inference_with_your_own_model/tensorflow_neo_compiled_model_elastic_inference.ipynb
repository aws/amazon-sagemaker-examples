    "# Using Amazon Elastic Inference with Neo-compiled TensorFlow model on SageMaker\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to compile a pre-trained TensorFlow model using Amazon SageMaker Neo and how to deploy this model to a SageMaker Endpoint with Elastic Inference\n",

    "Amazon Elastic Inference (EI) allows you to add inference acceleration to an Amazon SageMaker hosted endpoint for a fraction of the cost of using a full GPU instance. Running Neo-compiled models on EI provides a performance boost by optimizing the model to produce low latency inferences. This would increase inference throughput and further reduce costs. For more information please visit: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ei.html\n",

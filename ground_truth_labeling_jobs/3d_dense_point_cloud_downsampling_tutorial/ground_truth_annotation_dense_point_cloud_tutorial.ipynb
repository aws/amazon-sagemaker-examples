    "## Annotation of Dense Point Clouds Using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to annotate dense point clouds using SageMaker Ground Truth. We define dense point clouds as point clouds with a high number of points per scene (> 500k) and have enough points relative to the feature size of a scene that labelers can still make out objects in the scene (cars, pedestrians, etc) while only looking at a subset of the scene's total points. When these conditions are met, you can often improve the labeling experience and throughput by reducing your scene's point cloud size through downsampling techniques. After labeling, you can either directly use labels on the full-size scene for some modalities (like object detection bounding boxes), or you can \"upsample\" your labels by doing some in-sample prediction of the unlabeled points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Kernel: `conda_python3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing required libraries and initializing session and other variables used in this notebook. By default, the notebook uses the default Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region you use to run this notebook. If you want to use a different S3 bucket, make sure it is in the same AWS Region you use to complete this tutorial, and specify the bucket name for `bucket`. It is also recommended to use an instance size with at least 16 GB of RAM."

Note that you can tune the number of points used as well as the distance metric and weighting scheme to influence how label inference is performed. If you label a few tiles in the full-size dataset, you can use those labeled tiles as ground truth to evaluate the accuracy of the K-NN predictions. This accuracy metric can then be used for hyperparameter tuning of K-NN or to try different inference algorithms to reduce your number of misclassified points between object boundaries, resulting in the lowest possible in-sample error rate."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated a couple approaches to performing downsampling on pointclouds for data labeling use cases. These approaches can also be applied as preprocessing steps before training and inference. The notebook demonstrated a simple step based approach as well as a a more complex approach where you broke the pointcloud bounds into voxels and replaced each voxel with a summary point created by taking the mean of all points in the voxel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You then learned how to convert these pointclouds into a SageMaker Ground Truth Semantic Segmentation job. Finally you learned how to take the resulting labels and apply them to the full-size point cloud using some in-sample prediction based on the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these approaches, you can save time and effort labeling high-density pointclouds by avoiding tiling and instead labeling downsampled pointclouds.\n",

    "If for some reason you didn't complete the labeling job, you can run the following command to stop it."

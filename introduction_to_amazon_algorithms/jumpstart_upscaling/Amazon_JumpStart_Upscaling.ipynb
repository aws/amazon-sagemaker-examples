    "Welcome to Amazon [SageMaker JumpStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html)! You can use Sagemaker JumpStart to solve many Machine Learning tasks through one-click in SageMaker Studio, or through [SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-prebuilt-models-with-sagemaker-jumpstart).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo notebook, we demonstrate how to use SageMaker Python SDK for Upscaling with state-of-the-art pre-trained Stable Diffusion models. Upscaling is the task of generating high resolution image given a low resolution image and a textual prompt describing the image. An image that is low resolution, blurry, and pixelated can be converted into a high resolution image that appears smoother, clearer, and more detailed. This process, called upscaling, can be applied to both real images and images generated by [text-to-image Stable Diffusion models](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/generate-images-from-text-with-the-stable-diffusion-model-on-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/). This can be used to enhance image quality in various industries such as e-commerce and real estate, as well as for artists and photographers. Additionally, upscaling can improve the visual quality of low-resolution images when displayed on high-resolution screens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable Diffusion uses an AI algorithm to upscale images, eliminating the need for manual work that may require manually filling gaps in an image. It has been trained on millions of images and can accurately predict high-resolution images, resulting in a significant increase in detail compared to traditional image upscalers. Additionally, unlike non-deep-learning techniques such as nearest neighbor, Stable Diffusion takes into account the context of the image, using a textual prompt to guide the upscaling process.\n",

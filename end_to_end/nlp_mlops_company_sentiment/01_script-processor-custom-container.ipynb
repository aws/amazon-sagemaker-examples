    "We will be using [SageMaker Studio Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines.html) to automate and run jobs in our pipleline. SageMaker Pipelines uses purpose built docker containers behind the scene to run jobs (aka [Steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-and-manage-steps.html)) in a sequence that you define (much like a DevOps CI/CD pipeline). You can build our own docker container with Python3, [Boto3 SDK](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) and [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) installs, so that you can make use of them to make calls to Amazon Fraud Detector APIs via Boto3 library and access SageMaker constructs such as Feature Store etc. via custom data processing scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve that, you will first have to build a docker image and push it to an [ECR (Elastic Container Registry)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repo in your account. Typically this can be done using `docker` CLI and `aws cli` in your local machine pretty easily. However, SageMaker makes it even easier to use this studio environment to build, create, and push any custom container to your ECR repository using a purpose built tool known as `sagemaker-studio-image-build` and use the custom container image in your Notebooks for your ML projects. \n",

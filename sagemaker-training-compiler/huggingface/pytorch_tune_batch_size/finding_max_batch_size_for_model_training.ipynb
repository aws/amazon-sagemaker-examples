    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The SageMaker Training Compiler allows AWS customers to train deep learning models faster on scalable GPU instances managed by SageMaker. The memory optimizations made by SageMaker Training Compiler typically allow for your training job to fit more data into GPU memory. By increasing the batch size as much as possible in your training job, you can speed up your training jobs even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a PyTorch fine-tuning job (Sequence_Len=512, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)) with a GPT-2 model from Hugging Face, the maximum batch size that can fit on an ml.p3.2xlarge instance increased from 6 to 20 with the Training Compiler enabled. A list of model examples and maximum batch sizes is available in the SageMaker Training Compiler documentation under \"Tested Models\": https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/training-compiler-support.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Notebook is to give you an example of how you can find the max batch size for a particular model and instance type. We show you how to find the max batch size for a gpt2 model below running on an `ml.p3.8xlarge` instance. You can customize this Notebook to fit your use case, and use the resulting max batch size as the value of your batch size parameter in your full training job.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, you'll use Hugging Face's `transformers` and `datasets` libraries with Amazon SageMaker Training Compiler to train the `gpt-2` model on the `Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 (SST2)` dataset. Please note that by using this notebook you will be downloading SST2 from https://huggingface.co/datasets/sst2 and can check dataset information and terms there. To get started, we need to set up the environment with a few prerequisite steps, for permissions, configurations, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook uses the HuggingFace training scripts (`run_mlm.py` and `run_clm.py`) and a hands-on script (`find_max_batch_size.py`) to iteratively search for the maximum batch for a given GPU instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook runs the `run_clm.py` by default, as will be shown in the following sections. If you want to test with your own training script, you need to update the following:\n",
    "- The `find_max_batch_size.py` script - In line 23 to 28 of the script, specify the right directory path and the file name of your training script.\n",
    "- `hyperparameters` - In the following Tune a Native PyTorch Training Job section, modify the hyperparameters that your training script requires accordingly."

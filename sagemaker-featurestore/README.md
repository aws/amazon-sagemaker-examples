# Amazon SageMake Feature Store

## Introduction to Feature Store
In feature_store_introduction.ipynb we demonstrate how to get started with Feature Store, create feature groups, and ingest data into them.

This notebook requires these data sets in `/data/`, `customer.csv`, `orders.csv`, and uses these images, feature-store-policy.png, and feature_store_data_ingest.svg.

For an advanced example on how to use Feature Store for a Fraud Detection use-case, see [Fraud Detection with Feature Store](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-featurestore/sagemaker_featurestore_fraud_detection_python_sdk.html), and it's associated notebook, sagemaker_featurestore_fraud_detection_python_sdk.ipynb.

For detailed information about Feature Store, see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/feature-store.html).

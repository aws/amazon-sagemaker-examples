### SageMaker TensorFlow Image classification Training & Deployment
This notebook `Amazon_TensorFlow_Image_Classification.ipynb` demos how to fine-tune and deploy a pre-trained image classification model using SageMaker API. It shows how to select a pre-trained TensorFlow image classification model and fine-tune it on an example dataset containing raw .jpg/.png images, while varying training hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch-size and number of epochs. AMT (Automatic Model Tuning) is used to search for the best hyperparameters. Once the training is complete, the notebook shows how to host the trained model for inference. It also shows how to host the pre-trained model as-it-is without first fine-tuning it.

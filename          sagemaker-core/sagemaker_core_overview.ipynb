    "## Introductions\n",
    "SageMakerCore is a Python SDK designed as a lightweight layer over boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. It is built on the concept of resource level abstractions, where SageMaker Resources are represented as Python classes. This approach enables SageMakerCore to simplify the management of SageMaker Resources and provide a more object-oriented programming interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource Level Abstraction\n",
    "Resource Level Abstractions can be best understood by examining how the AWS TrainingJob APIs are transfromed into a TrainingJob Python class abstraction in SageMakerCore.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an AWS TrainingJob has the following APIs:\n",
    "1. CreateTrainingJob\n",
    "2. DescribeTrainingJob\n",
    "3. UpdateTrainingJob\n",
    "4. StopTrainingJob\n",
    "5. ListTrainingJobs\n",
    "\n",
    "In SageMakerCore, these APIs are encapsulated within a TrainingJob class that exposes these operations as methods and attributes. The details of the TrainingJob class are below:"

    "# Solving Multi-Period Newsvendor Problem with Amazon SageMaker RL\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows an example of how to use reinforcement learning to solve a version of online stochastic Newsvendor problem. This problem is well-studied in inventory management wherein one must decide on an ordering decision (how much of an item to purchase from a supplier) to cover a single period of uncertain demand. The objective is to trade-off the various costs incurred and revenues achieved during the period, usually consisting of sales revenue, purchasing and holding costs, loss\n",
    "of goodwill in the case of missed sales, and the terminal salvage value of unsold items."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The case considered here is stationary, single-product and multi-period, with vendor lead time (VLT) and stochastic demand. The VLT $l$ refers to the number of time steps between the placement and receipt of an order. When formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), the RL agent is aware of the following information at each time step:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mean demand\n",
    "* Item purchase cost, sold price\n",
    "* lost sale penalty for each unit of unmet demand, holding cost if any unit is left over at the end of a period\n",
    "* on-hand inventory and the units to be received within the next VLT periods\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step, the agent can take a continuous action, consisting of the size of the order placed and to arrive $l$ time periods later. The reward is then calculated as the difference between revenue from selling and cost of buying/storing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time horizon is 40 steps. You can see the specifics in the `NewsVendorGymEnvironment` class in `news_vendor_env.py`. A normalized version(`NewsVendorGymEnvironmentNormalized`) of this problem is used in this notebook. "

You do not have to worry about setting up your machines with the RL toolkits and deep learning frameworks.

You can also choose to use multiple machines in a cluster to further speedup training, often necessary for production level loads."

# Amazon SageMaker Examples

Example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to build, train, and deploy machine learning models using Amazon SageMaker.

## :books: Background

[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is a fully managed service for data science and machine learning (ML) workflows.
You can use Amazon SageMaker to simplify the process of building, training, and deploying ML models.

The [SageMaker example notebooks](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the usage of Amazon SageMaker.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup

The quickest setup to run example notebooks includes:
- An [AWS account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-account.html)
- Proper [IAM User and Role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/authentication-and-access-control.html) setup
- An [Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.html)
- An [S3 bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-config-permissions.html)

## :computer: Usage

These example notebooks are automatically loaded into SageMaker Notebook Instances.
They can be accessed by clicking on the `SageMaker Examples` tab in Jupyter or the SageMaker logo in JupyterLab.

Although most examples utilize key Amazon SageMaker functionality like distributed, managed training or real-time hosted endpoints, these notebooks can be run outside of Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances with minimal modification (updating IAM role definition and installing the necessary libraries).

As of February 7, 2022, the default branch is named "main". See our [announcement](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/discussions/3131) for details and how to update your existing clone.

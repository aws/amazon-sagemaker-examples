In this example we use the k-nearest-neighbours algorithm to train our model. The permutation feature importance score is the decrease in models score when this single feature value is shuffled. The decrease in the model score is representative of how dependant the model is on the feature. This technique can be computed many times with altering permutations per feature. "

From these lists we can infer unimportant features based on their importance scores and can eliminate them from our training, validation and test sets. For example, if feature A has a higher importance score then feature B's importance score, then this implies that feature A is more important then feature B and vice versa.

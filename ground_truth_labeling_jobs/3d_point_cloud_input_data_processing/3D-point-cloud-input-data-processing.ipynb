    "This notebook will demonstrate how you can pre-process your 3D point cloud input data to create an [object tracking labeling job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-object-tracking.html) and include sensor and camera data for sensor fusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In object tracking, you are tracking the movement of an object (e.g., a pedestrian on the side walk) while your point of reference (e.g., the autonomous vehicle) is moving. When performing object tracking, your data must be in a global reference coordinate system such as [world coordinate system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-sensor-fusion-details.html#sms-point-cloud-world-coordinate-system) because the ego vehicle itself is moving in the world. You can transform point cloud data in local coordinates to the world coordinate system by multiplying each of the points in a 3D frame with the extrinsic matrix for the LiDAR sensor. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will transform 3D frames from a local coordinate system to a world coordinate system using extrinsic matrices. You will use the KITTI dataset<sup>[1](#The-Dataset-and-Input-Manifest-Files)</sup>, an open source autonomous driving dataset. The KITTI dataset provides an extrinsic matrix for each 3D point cloud frame. You will use [pykitti](https://github.com/utiasSTARS/pykitti) and the [numpy matrix multiplication function](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html) to multiple this matrix with each point in the frame to translate that point to the world coordinate system used by the KITTI dataset. \n",

    "You include camera image data and provide workers with more visual information about the scene they are labeling. Through sensor fusion, workers will be able to adjust labels in the 3D scene and in 2D images, and label adjustments will be mirrored in the other view. \n",

This is typically done by first transforming 3D points from LIDAR’s own coordinate to a world coordinate system using the LIDAR extrinsic matrix. Then we use the camera inverse extrinsic (world to camera) to transform the 3D points from the world coordinate system we obtained in previous step into camera image plane.

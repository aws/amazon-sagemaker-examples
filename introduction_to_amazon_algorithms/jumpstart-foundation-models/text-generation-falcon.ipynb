It was built using custom-built tooling for data pre-processing and model training built on Amazon SageMaker. As of June 6, 2023, it is the best open-source model currently available. Falcon-40B outperforms LLaMA, StableLM, RedPajama, MPT, etc. To see comparison, see [OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard). It features an architecture optimized for inference, with FlashAttention and multiquery. \n",

To use this model, please select `model_id` in the cell above to be \"huggingface-textgeneration-falcon-7b-bf16\".\n",

It has surpassed renowned models like LLaMA-65B, StableLM, RedPajama and MPT on the public leaderboard maintained by Hugging Face, demonstrating its exceptional performance without specialized fine-tuning.

    "* **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches `max_new_tokens`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **num_beams:** Number of beams used in the greedy search. If specified, it must be integer greater than or equal to `num_return_sequences`.\n",
    "* **no_repeat_ngram_size:** Model ensures that a sequence of words of `no_repeat_ngram_size` is not repeated in the output sequence. If specified, it must be a positive integer greater than 1.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",
    "* **early_stopping:** If True, text generation is finished when all beam hypotheses reach the end of sentence token. If specified, it must be boolean.\n",
    "* **do_sample:** If True, sample the next word as per the likelihood. If specified, it must be boolean.\n",
    "* **top_k:** In each step of text generation, sample from only the `top_k` most likely words. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.\n",
    "* **return_full_text:** If True, input text will be part of the output generated text. If specified, it must be boolean. The default value for it is False.\n",
    "* **stop**: If specified, it must a list of strings. Text generation stops if any one of the specified strings is generated.\n",

    "Note that, limits don't apply equally to input tokens and new tokens. Models typically support much larger input tokens if you decrease max_new_tokens slightly. Also, note that non-default values of inference parameters will impact the size of input and output payload supported. For instance, higher value of num_beams will reduce the number of `max_new_tokens` you can generate.\n",

    "**Words-Token ratio:** Ratio of words to tokens is roughly 1.5. So, if number of input tokens 900, it corresponds to ~600 input words. Note that this is not always the case. There are several pieces of text where words-tokens ratio can be significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting non-default environment variables:** If setting num_input_tokens >1024 or num_total_tokens >=2048, you would need to change the environment variable before deploying the model:\n",
    "    my_model.env['MAX_INPUT_LENGTH'] = '2048' (default '1024')\n",
    "    my_model.env['MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS'] = '4096' (default '2048')\n",

    "\n",
    "**Concurrency/invoking at short intervals:** When sending multiple requests at once or at very short interval, the endpoint can not handle the same thresholds as above. It may result in OOM CUDA error. Thus, we recommend trying smaller number of input and output tokens than mentioned above. This is because the TGI container batches requests. While this results in significant throughput improvements, it may cause CUDA OOM or timeout errors. To reduce the number of batched requests, you can set the `max_concurrent_requests` parameter (my_model.env['MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS'] = '1').\n",
    "\n",
    "**Corrupted endpoint state:** It has been observed that once an endpoint suffers a CUDA OOM error, the endpoint may get in corrupted state where it may not function for very small inputs and small `max_new_token` parameter. It has been observed that letting endpoint sit ideally can help reset the state. If that does not work, please restart the endpoint (delete and launch a new endpoint).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model quality:** Note that above limits only refer to the memory limitation of the instance types available and the sagemaker endpoint response timeout limit. Model itself can theoretically support arbitrary large input and output payload if infinite CUDA memory is available and there is no limit on sagemaker endpoint response time. However, it has been observed that the quality of the model's output decrease substantially when provided a very large input payload (eg. generate summary of a document with 20,000 tokens) or generate large outputs (write a story with 2000 tokens). Thus, you may want to stay below the limits recommended above to generate high quality outputs.\n",

    "As observed above, model can support much larger input tokens than output tokens. For instance, endpoint has higher latency and more memory requirement when given an input sequence of length 100 tokens and generating 100 tokens compared to the case with input sequence of length 190 tokens and generating 10 new tokens. Based on this observation, we can set up our text generation process to avoid CUDA OOM issue and endpoint response timeout issue by  invoke endpoint repeatedly to generate very large output sequence which would have been otherwise infeasible. For Falcon 40b instruct model, we observed that you can generate more than 5000 new tokens on `ml.g5.12xlarge` if you generate 100 tokens at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also experimented with the computation overhead of repeatedly querying endpoint and thus computing activations/states for the input text mutliple times. We observed that even when generating 10 tokens at a time, this contributed less than 5% of the overall time to generate the desired number of output tokens. Thus, even when generating the entire sequence is feasible for a single query, you can simply generate generate in batches.\n",

For PrM, class imbalance is oftentimes a problem as failues happen less frequently and businesses do not want to allow for more failures than is necessary. There are a variety of techniques for dealing with class imbalances in data such as [SMOTE](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html).

You can use Sagemaker JumpStart to solve many Machine Learning tasks through one-click in SageMaker Studio, or through [SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-prebuilt-models-with-sagemaker-jumpstart).\n",

    "In this demo notebook, we demonstrate how to use the SageMaker Python SDK for doing the [Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html) and Real-Time Batch Inference for various NLP tasks. Batch transform allows you to perform inference on large datasets without the need for real-time interaction with the model. In batch transform, you start by creating a batch transform job, which takes as input a dataset and a pre-trained model, and outputs predictions for each data point in the dataset. Batch transform can be useful in situations where you have a large dataset that needs to be processed in a time-efficient manner. \n",

    "Real-time batch inference is a technique that combines the benefits of real-time and batch inference. In this approach, data is processed in batches, but the batches are small enough to enable real-time processing. Real-time batch inference is useful in situations where you need to process a continuous stream of data in near real-time, but it is not feasible to process each data point individually due to time or resource constraints. Instead, you process the data in small batches, which enables you to take advantage of parallel processing while still maintaining low latency. By using real-time batch inference, you can achieve a balance between low latency and high throughput, enabling you to process large volumes of data in a timely and efficient manner.\n",

Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words.

    "In this notebook, we conducted Batch Transform and Real-Time Batch inference. Additionally, we used the Rouge score to compare the test data summarization with the model-generated summarization. We found that Batch Transform is advantageous in obtaining inferences from large datasets without requiring a persistent endpoint. Furthermore, we linked input records with inferences to aid in result interpretation. On the other hand, Real-Time Batch inference is beneficial in achieving high throughput.\n",

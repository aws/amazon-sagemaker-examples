# Training Batch Reinforcement Learning Policies with Amazon SageMaker RL

For many real-world problems, the reinforcement learning (RL) agent needs to learn from historical data that was generated by some deployed policy. For example, we may have historical data of experts playing games, users interacting with a website or sensor data from a control system. This notebook shows an example of how to use batch RL to train a new policy from offline dataset. We use gym `CartPole-v0` as a fake simulated system to generate offline dataset and the RL agents are trained using Amazon SageMaker RL.

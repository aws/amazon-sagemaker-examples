    "GPT2 ([Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf)) algorithm is an unsupervised transformer language model. Transformer language models take advantage of transformer blocks. These blocks make it possible to process intra-sequence dependencies for all tokens in a sequence at the same time. GPT2 has been developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and is a powerful generative NLP model that excels in processing long-range dependencies and it is pre-trained on a diverse corpus of text.\n",

    "In [step 1](#Step-1:-Determine-input-prompt-and-visualize-word-dependencies) of this notebook, you will determine an input prompt that will be used to condition the GPT-2 model for text generation. You will also [visualize attention](#Step-1.1-Introduction-to-attention) mechanism of GPT-2 model. In [step 2](#Step-2:-Use-an-ML-model-to-generate-text-based-on-prompt), you will create the model from an AWS Marketplace subscription, and deploy to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. In [step 3](#Step-3:-Explore-use-cases-and-model-parameters), you will explore text generation use cases with various model parameter settings. In [step 4](#Step-4:-Use-Amazon-SageMaker-batch-transform), you will perform inference asynchronously using SageMaker batch transform instead of the endpoint. In [Step 5](#Step-5:-Next-steps) you will find additional models to explore and experiment with."

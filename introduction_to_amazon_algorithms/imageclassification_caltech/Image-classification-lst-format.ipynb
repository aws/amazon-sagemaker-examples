The main parameters that need to be set is the \"ContentType\" which can be set to \"application/x-recordio\" or \"application/x-image\" based on the input data format and the S3Uri which specifies the bucket and the folder where the data is present. \n",
    "* **Output specification**: This is specified in the \"OutputDataConfig\" section. We just need to specify the path where the output can be stored after training\n",

    "* **num_training_samples**: This is the total number of training samples. It is set to 15240 for caltech dataset with the current split.\n",
    "* **num_classes**: This is the number of output classes for the new dataset. Imagenet was trained with 1000 output classes but the number of output classes can be changed for fine-tuning. For caltech, we use 257 because it has 256 object categories + 1 clutter class.\n",

    "* **learning_rate**: Learning rate for training.\n",

    "* **checkpoint_frequency**: Period to store model parameters (in number of epochs).\n",

    "# Chaining using Ground Truth Streaming Labeling Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a streaming labeling job to perpetually send new data objects to Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth to be labeled. Ground Truth streaming labeling jobs remain active until they are manually stopped or have been idle for more than 10 days. You can intermittently send new data objects to workers while the labeling job is active. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use this notebook to create a Ground Truth streaming labeling job using any of the [built-in task types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-task-types.html). You can make necessary parameter changes for the custom workflow. You can either configure the notebook to create a labeling job using your own input data, or run the notebook on *default* mode and use provided, image input data. **To use your own input data, set `DEFAULT` to `False`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaining is a powerful feature that you can use to send the output of one streaming labeling job to another streaming labeling job. This opens up multiple possibilities to setup jobs so that data of Job 1 and can flow to Job2, Data of Job 2 can flow to Job n-1, data of Job n-1 can flow to Job n in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show how you can use 2 such streaming jobs in a chained fashion. If you select `DEFAULT` to `True`, we setup Job 1 which is an \"Object Detection\" job where one can draw bounding boxes around objects and Job 2 to be an \"Object Detection Adjustment\" job where one can adjust the previously drawn bounding boxes from Job 1."

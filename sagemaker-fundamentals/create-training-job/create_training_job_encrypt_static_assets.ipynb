    "## Symmetric Ciphers\n",
    "We will focus on symmetric ciphers in this notebook. Quote from the GNU Privacy Handbook\n",
    "\n",
    "> A symmetric cipher is a cipher that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Two parties communicating using a symmetric cipher must agree on the key beforehand. Once they agree, the sender encrypts a message using the key, sends it to the receiver, and the receiver decrypts the message using the key. As an example, the German Enigma is a symmetric cipher, and daily keys were distributed as code books. Each day, a sending or receiving radio operator would consult his copy of the code book to find the day's key. Radio traffic for that day was then encrypted and decrypted using the day's key. Modern examples of symmetric ciphers include 3DES, Blowfish, and IDEA."

    "\n",
    ">A grant is a policy instrument that allows AWS principals to use AWS KMS key in cryptographic operations. It also can let them view a CMK (DescribeKey) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a CMK, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies. Because grants can be very specific, and are easy to create and revoke, they are often used to provide temporary permissions or more granular permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will the grant approach this tutorial as it involves less activities on your key policy. In a prodcution environment, you should think of an activity on your key policy as *a big deal*. "

    "* Created a SageMaker training job and passed the encrypted data key to the training job\n",

    "    * A: There are many technical details to take care of when doing client-side encryption. The purpose of this tutorial is to show you the basic concepts involved in client-side encryption. [AWS Encryption SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html) is a library for client-side encryption and it can take care much of nuts and bolts for you. You are highly encouraged to explore it. \n",

    "* I do not like to build my AWS credentials into an image.\n",
    "    * A: A much better way to access your credentials when running a container service like SageMaker training job is to use [`ContainerProvider`](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/botocore/credentials.py#L1819). This class can be used for a wider range of problems, so we will discuss it in an standalone notebook. "

SageMaker Workshop
==================

SageMaker Workshop is a series of lectures with the objective of teaching basic machine learning concenpts to software engineers. The platform that will be used in these lectures is the [SageMaker Notebook](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). The pre-requisites for this series is basic calculus, linear algebra, knowledge of programming in python and libraries such as numpy, tensorflow and mxnet. 

Format of the lectures
----------------------

The lectures will be one hour long. There will two types of lectures. The introductory lectures will cover the science aspects and the follow-up lectures will cover the programming aspects. As we proceed further along the material, we will lectures that will introduce the [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/README.rst) while implemeting some of the material.

    "# Distributed data parallel BERT model training with PyTorch and SMDataParallel\n",
    "\n",
    "SMDataParallel is a new capability in Amazon SageMaker to train deep learning models faster and cheaper. SMDataParallel is a distributed data parallel training framework for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook example shows how to use SMDataParallel with PyTorch(version 1.6.0) on [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to train a BERT model using [Amazon FSx for Lustre file-system](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/) as data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of steps is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stage dataset in [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Original dataset for BERT pretraining consists of text passages from BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al. 2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words). Please follow original guidelines by NVidia to prepare training data in hdf5 format - \n",
    "https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/blob/master/PyTorch/LanguageModeling/BERT/README.md#getting-the-data\n",
    "2. Create Amazon FSx Lustre file-system and import data into the file-system from S3\n",
    "3. Build Docker training image and push it to [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)\n",
    "4. Configure data input channels for SageMaker\n",
    "5. Configure hyper-prarameters\n",
    "6. Define training metrics\n",
    "7. Define training job, set distribution strategy to SMDataParallel and start training\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**  With large traning dataset, we recommend using (Amazon FSx)[https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/] as the input filesystem for the SageMaker training job. FSx file input to SageMaker significantly cuts down training start up time on SageMaker because it avoids downloading the training data each time you start the training job (as done with S3 input for SageMaker training job) and provides good data read throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This example requires SageMaker Python SDK v2.X.\n"

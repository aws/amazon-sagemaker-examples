    "# Create a 3D Point Cloud Labeling Job with Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook takes you through an end-to-end workflow to demonstrate the functionality of SageMaker Ground Truth 3D point cloud built-in task types. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Point Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "A point cloud frame is defined as a collection of 3D points describing a 3D scene. Each point is described using three coordinates, x, y, and z. To add color and/or variations in point intensity to the point cloud, points may have additional attributes, such as i for intensity or values for the red (r), green (g), and blue (b) color channels (8-bit). All of the positional coordinates (x, y, z) are in meters. Point clouds are most commonly created from data that was collected by scanning the real world through various scanning methods, such as laser scanning and photogrammetry. Ground Truth currently also supports sensor fusion with video camera data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3D Point Cloud Built in Task Types\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Ground Truth 3D point cloud labeling built-in task types to annotate 3D point cloud data. The following list briefly describes each task type. See [3D Point Cloud Task types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-task-types.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3D point cloud object detection – Use this task type when you want workers to indentify the location of and classify objects in a 3D point cloud by drawing 3D cuboids around objects. You can include one or more attributes for each class (label) you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3D point cloud object tracking – Use this task type when you want workers to track the trajectory of an object across a sequence of 3D point cloud frames. For example, you can use this task type to ask workers to track the movement of vehicles across a sequence of point cloud frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3D point cloud semantic segmentation – Use this task type when you want workers to create a point-level semantic segmentation mask by painting objects in a 3D point cloud using different colors where each color is assigned to one of the classes you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the Adjustment task types to verify and adjust annotations created for the three task types above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensor Fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important features of this product is sensor fusion, which fuses the inputs of multiple sensors to provide labelers with a better understanding of the 3D scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a 3D point cloud labeling job, you can optionally provide camera data for sensor fusion. Ground Truth uses your camera data to include images in the worker UI. These images give workers more visual information about scenes in the 3D point cloud visualization and can be used to annotate (draw 3D cuboids or paint) objects. When a worker adjusts annotation around an object in either the 2D image or the 3D point cloud, the adjustments shows up in the other medium. This tutorial will demonstrate how you can include image data in your input manifest file for sensor fusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "## This Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, you'll start by inspecting the input data and manifest files used to in the demo. Then, you will specifying resources needed to create a labeling job. In this step, you'll have the option to make yourself a worker on a private work team that you send the labeling job tasks to. This will allow you can preview and interact with the worker UI. Finally, you'll configure and send your CreateLabelingJob request.\n",
    "\n",
    "After your labeling job has been created, you can check your labeling job status. When the job is completed, you can view the output in Amazon S3. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you can simply execute each cell in order. To understand what's happening, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An S3 bucket you can write to -- please provide its name in `BUCKET`. The bucket must be in the same region as this SageMaker Notebook instance. You can also change the `EXP_NAME` to any valid S3 prefix. All the files related to this experiment will be stored in that prefix of your bucket. **Important: you must attach the CORS policy to this bucket. See the next section for more information**.\n",
    "* Familiarity with the [Ground Truth 3D Point Cloud Labeling Job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud.html).\n",
    "* Familiarity with Python and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/).\n",
    "* Basic familiarity with [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html).\n",
    "* Basic understanding of [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).\n",
    "* Basic familiarity with [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) -- ideally, you should have it set up with credentials to access the AWS account you're running this notebook from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has only been tested on a SageMaker notebook instance. The runtimes given are approximate. We used an `ml.t2.medium` instance in our tests. However, you can likely run it on a local instance by first executing the cell below on SageMaker and then copying the `role` string to your local copy of the notebook."

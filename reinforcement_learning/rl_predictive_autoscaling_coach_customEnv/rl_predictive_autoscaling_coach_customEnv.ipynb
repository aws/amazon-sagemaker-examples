    "# Autoscaling a service with Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows an example of how to use reinforcement learning technique to address a very common problem in production operation of software systems: scaling a production service by adding and removing resources (e.g. servers or EC2 instances) in reaction to dynamically changing load. This example is a simple toy demonstrating how one might begin to address this real and challenging problem. We build up a fake simulated system with daily and weekly variations and occassional spikes. It also has a delay between when new resources are requested and when they become available for serving requests. The customized environment is constructed using Open AI gym and the RL agents are trained using Amazon SageMaker."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoscaling enables services to dynamically update capacity up or down automatically depending on conditions you define. Today, this requires setting up alarms, scaling policies, thresholds etc. Under the customized simulator, the RL problem for autoscaling can be defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Objective*: Optimize profit of a scalable web service by adapting instance capacity to load profile. Meanwhile, ensure the servers/instances are sufficient when a spike occurs.\n",
    "2. *Environment*: Custom developed environment that includes the load profile. It generates a fake simulated load with daily and weekly variations and occasional spikes. The simulated system has a delay between when new resources are requested and when they become available for serving requests.\n",
    "3. *State*: A time-weighted combination of previous and current observations. At each timestamp, an observation includes current load (transactions this minute), number of failed transactions, a boolean variable indicating whether the service is in downtime (when availability drops below 99.5%), and the current number of active machines.\n",
    "4. *Action*: Remove or add machines. The agent can do both at the same time.\n",
    "5. *Reward*: A customized reward function based on a simple financial model. On top of positive reward for successful transactions, we take costs for running machines into consideration. We also apply a high penalty for downtime."

You do not have to worry about setting up your machines with the RL toolkits and deep learning frameworks.

You can also choose to use multiple machines in a cluster to further speedup training, often necessary for production level loads."

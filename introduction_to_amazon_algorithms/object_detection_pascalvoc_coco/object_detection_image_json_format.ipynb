    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Object detection is the process of identifying and localizing objects in an image. A typical object detection solution takes in an image as input and provides a bounding box on the image where an object of interest is, along with identifying what object the box encapsulates. But before we have this solution, we need to acquire and process a traning dataset, create and setup a training job for the alorithm so that the aglorithm can learn about the dataset and then host the algorithm as an endpoint, to which we can supply the query image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an end-to-end example introducing the Amazon SageMaker Object Detection algorithm. In this demo, we will demonstrate how to train and to host an object detection model on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/) using the Single Shot multibox Detector ([SSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)) algorithm. In doing so, we will also demonstrate how to construct a training dataset using the JSON format as this is the format that the training job will consume. We also allow the RecordIO format, which is illustrated in the [RecordIO Notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/object_detection_pascalvoc_coco/object_detection_recordio_format.ipynb). We will also demonstrate how to host and validate this trained model."

Firstly, the instances that we requested while creating the `Estimator` classes are provisioned and are setup with the appropriate libraries. Then, the data from our channels are downloaded into the instance. Once this is done, the training job begins. The provisioning and data downloading will take time, depending on the size of the data. Therefore it might be a few minutes before we start getting data logs for our training jobs. The data logs will also print out Mean Average Precision (mAP) on the validation data, among other losses, for every run of the dataset once or one epoch.

    "## Background\n",
    "SMDataParallel is a new capability in Amazon SageMaker to train deep learning models faster and cheaper. SMDataParallel is a distributed data parallel training framework for PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook example shows how to use SMDataParallel with PyTorch in SageMaker using MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information:\n",
    "1. [PyTorch in SageMaker](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/pytorch/using_pytorch.html)\n",
    "2. [SMDataParallel PyTorch API Specification](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/smd_data_parallel_pytorch.html)\n",
    "3. [Getting started with SMDataParallel on SageMaker](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/smd_data_parallel.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This example requires SageMaker Python SDK v2.X.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "This example uses the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits).\n",

See the [Amazon SageMaker Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html) for how to create these. Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the sagemaker.get_execution_role() with the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

    "The training script provides the code you need for distributed data parallel (DDP) training using SMDataParallel. The training script is very similar to a PyTorch training script you might run outside of SageMaker, but modified to run with SMDataParallel. SMDataParallel's PyTorch client provides an alternative to PyTorch's native DDP. For details about how to use SMDataParallel's DDP in your native PyTorch script, see the Getting Started with SMDataParallel tutorials.\n"

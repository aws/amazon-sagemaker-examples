    "IoU (Intersection over Union) is a commonly used evaluation metric for object detection. It's calculated by dividing the area of overlap between two bounding boxes by the area of union for two bounding boxes. While it's typically used to evaluate the accuracy of a predicted box against a ground truth box, you can use it to evaulate how much overlap a given bounding box has from one frame of a video to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are differences from one frame to the next, we would not expect a given bounding box for a single object to have 100% overlap with the corresponding bounding box from the next frame. However, depending on the frames per second (FPS) for the video, there often is only a small change between one frame and the next since the time elapsed between frames is only a fraction of a second. For higher FPS video, we would expect a substantial amount of overlap between frames. The MOT17 videos are all shot at 25 FPS, so these videos qualify. Operating with this assumption, you can use IoU to identify outlier frames where you see substantial differences between a bounding box in one frame to the next. \n"

    "SageMaker Ground Truth operates using [manifests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-input-data-input-manifest.html). When you use a modality like image classification, a single image corresponds to a single entry in a manifest and a given manifest contains paths for all of the images to be labeled. Because videos have multiple frames and you can have [multiple videos in a single manifest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-video-manual-data-setup.html), a manifest is instead organized with a JSON sequence file for each video that contains the paths to frames in Amazon S3. This allows a single manifest to contain multiple videos for a single job.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the image files are all split out, so you can just grab file paths. If your data is in the form of video files, you can use the Ground Truth console to split videos into video frames. To learn more, see [Automated Video Frame Input Data Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-video-automated-data-setup.html). You can also use other tools like [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to split video files into individual image frames. The following block stores file paths in a dictionary.\n"

    "\n",
    "This notebook introduced how to measure the quality of annotations using statistical analysis and various quality metrics like IoU, rolling IoU, and embedding comparisons. It also demonstrated how to flag frames which may not be labeled properly using these quality metrics and how to send those frames for verification and audit jobs using SageMaker Ground Truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this approach, you can perform automated quality checks on the annotations at scale, which reduces the number of frames humans need to verify or audit. Please try the notebook with your own data and add your own quality metrics for different task types supported by SageMaker Ground Truth. With this process in place, you can generate high-quality datasets for a wide range of business use cases in a cost-effective manner without compromising the quality of annotations."

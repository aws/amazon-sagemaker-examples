    "# Distributed Data Parallel EfficientNet Training with PyTorch and SageMaker Distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon SageMaker's distributed library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/distributed-training.html) can be used to train deep learning models faster and cheaper. The [data parallel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-parallel.html) feature in this library (`smdistributed.dataparallel`) is a distributed data parallel training framework for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use `smdistributed.dataparallel` with PyTorch on [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to train an EfficientNet model on a large image dataset such as [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/download.php) using [Amazon FSx for Lustre file-system](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/) as data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of steps is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stage the ImageNet dataset files on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)\n",
    "2. Create Amazon FSx Lustre file-system and import data into the file-system from S3\n",
    "3. Build Docker training image and push it to [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)\n",
    "4. Configure data input channels for SageMaker\n",
    "5. Configure hyper-prarameters\n",
    "6. Define training metrics\n",
    "7. Define training job, set distribution strategy to SMDataParallel and start training\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** With large training dataset such as ImageNet, we recommend using [Amazon FSx](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/) as the input file system for the SageMaker training job. FSx file input to SageMaker significantly cuts down training start up time on SageMaker because it avoids downloading the training data each time you start the training job (as done with S3 input for SageMaker training job) and provides good data read throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This example requires SageMaker Python SDK v2.X."

### SageMaker JumpStart Text Classification Training & Deployment
We have two notebooks for text classification. Their description is as follows - \
(1). The notebook `Amazon_JumpStart_Text_Classification.ipynb` uses tensorflow models for Text Classification and demonstrates (a) how to use a pre-trained model available in JumpStart for inference, and (b) how to fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer model on a custom dataset using JumpStart transfer learning algorithm, using AMT (Automatic Model Tuning) to search for the best hyperparameters , and how to use the fine-tuned model for inference.\
(2). This notebook `Amazon_JumpStart_HuggingFace_Text_Classification.ipynb` uses huggingface models for Text Classification and demonstrates (a) how to use a pre-trained model available in JumpStart for inference, (b) how to fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer model on a custom dataset using JumpStart transfer learning algorithm, using AMT (Automatic Model Tuning) to search for the best hyperparameters , and how to use the fine-tuned model for inference, and (c) how to run batch inference

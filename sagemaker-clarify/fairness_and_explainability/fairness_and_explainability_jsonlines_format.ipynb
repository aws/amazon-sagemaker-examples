    "Amazon SageMaker Clarify helps improve your machine learning models by detecting potential bias and helping explain how these models make predictions. The fairness and explainability functionality provided by SageMaker Clarify takes a step towards enabling AWS customers to build trustworthy and understandable machine learning models. The product comes with the tools to help you with the following tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measure biases that can occur during each stage of the ML lifecycle (data collection, model training and tuning, and monitoring of ML models deployed for inference).\n",
    "* Generate model governance reports targeting risk and compliance teams and external regulators.\n",
    "* Provide explanations of the data, models, and monitoring used to assess predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook walks you through:  \n",
    "1. Key terms and concepts needed to understand SageMaker Clarify\n",
    "1. Measuring the pre-training bias of a dataset and post-training bias of a model\n",
    "1. Explaining the importance of the various input features on the model's decision\n",
    "1. Accessing the reports through SageMaker Studio if you have an instance set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In doing so, the notebook will first train a [SageMaker Linear Learner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html) model using training dataset, then use SageMaker Clarify to analyze a testing dataset in [SageMaker JSON Lines dense format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-inference.html#common-in-formats). SageMaker Clarify also supports analyzing CSV dataset, which is illustrated in [another notebook](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/sagemaker-clarify/fairness_and_explainability/fairness_and_explainability.ipynb)."

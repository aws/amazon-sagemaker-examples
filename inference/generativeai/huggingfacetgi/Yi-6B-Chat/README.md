#  Hosting Yi-6B-Chat on Amazon SageMaker using HuggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI)

This notebook demonstrates how to deploy Hosting Yi-6B-Chat transformer models using Hugging Face Text Generation Inference (TGI) Deep Learning Container on Amazon SageMaker.

The [Yi series](https://huggingface.co/01-ai) models are the next generation of open-source large language models trained from scratch by [01.AI](https://01.ai/).For English language capability, the Yi series models ranked 2nd (just behind GPT-4), outperforming other LLMs (such as LLaMA2-chat-70B, Claude 2, and ChatGPT) on the [AlpacaEval Leaderboard](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/) in Dec 2023.

TGI is an open source, high performance inference library that can be used to deploy large language models from Hugging Faceâ€™s repository in minutes. The library includes advanced functionality like model parallelism and dynamic batching to simplify production inference with large language models like flan-t5-xxl, LLaMa, StableLM, and GPT-NeoX.

    "# Solving Bin Packing Problem with Amazon SageMaker RL\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows an example of how to use reinforcement learning to solve the online stochastic bin packing problem. In the classic version of bin packing, we are given items of different sizes and need to pack them into as few bins as possible. In the online stochastic version, items arrive one at a time and item sizes are drawn from an unknown distribution. The task is to find a feasible packing that minimizes the number of bins used to pack all of the items that arrive within the time horizon."

    "\n",
    "In the stochastic bin packing problem, items arrive online, one in each time period $t$. Items can be of different sizes. Upon arrival, the item needs to be packed into one of the bins. We assume the number of bins one can open is unlimited. Assuming each bin has size of $10$, the usage is illustrated in the figure below. Each rectangle corresponds to a bin, with a utilization level between 0 (empty) to 10 (full)."

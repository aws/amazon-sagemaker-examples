# XGBoost for Direct Marketing

This folder contains two notebooks:

*xgboost_direct_marketing.ipynb:* is an introduction to machine learning for less technical users.  The task is the same as the Amazon ML [tutorial](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/tutorial.html), but showcases the flexibility of running this analysis in a notebook environment.

*xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker.ipynb:* is very similar, but utilizes Amazon Amazon SageMaker concepts beyond the hosted notebook environment, relying on serverless, distributed training and creating a hosted endpoint for realtime predictions.

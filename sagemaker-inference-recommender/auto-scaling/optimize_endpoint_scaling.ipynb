    "Amazon SageMaker real-time endpoints allow you to host ML applications at scale. SageMaker Hosting offers various scaling options for real-time endpoint and they are detailed in this [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/configuring-autoscaling-inference-endpoints-in-amazon-sagemaker/). In summary, SageMaker endpoint supports three scaling options. The first and the recommended option is TragetTracking. In this option, a target value that represents the average utilization or/and throughput of single host is set as a scaling threshold. Secondly, you can define StepScaling, which is an advanced method for scaling based on the size of alarm breach. The final one is scheduled scaling, which lets you specify an one-time schedule or a recurring schedule. It is always recommended to combine the scaling options to better resilience. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we provide a design pattern for arriving right deployment configuration for your application. In addition, we provide a list of steps to follow, so even if your application has an unique behavior, such as a different system characteristics or traffic pattern, these systemic approach can be applied to arrive the scaling policies. The procedure is further simplified with the use of Inference recommender, a right sizing and benchmarking tool, built inside SageMaker. "

    "The process of defining the scaling policy for your application can be challenging. You must understand the characteristics of the application, determine your scaling needs, and iterate scaling policies to meet those needs. This notebook has reviewed each of these steps carefully and explained the approach you should take at each step. Furthermore, the notebook simplified the process with the SageMaker Inference recommender. You can find your application characteristics and evaluate scaling policies by using the Inference recommender benchmarking system. The proposed design pattern can help you create a scalable application that takes into account the availability and cost of your application in hours rather than days."

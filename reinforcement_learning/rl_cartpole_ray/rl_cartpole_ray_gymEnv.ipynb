    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll start from the cart-pole balancing problem, where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, moving along a frictionless track. Instead of applying control theory to solve the problem, this example shows how to solve the problem with reinforcement learning on Amazon SageMaker and Ray RLlib. You can choose either TensorFlow or PyTorch as your underlying DL framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For a similar example using Coach library, see this [link](../rl_cartpole_coach/rl_cartpole_coach_gymEnv.ipynb). Another Cart-pole example using Coach library and offline data can be found [here](../rl_cartpole_batch_coach/rl_cartpole_batch_coach.ipynb).)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Objective*: Prevent the pole from falling over\n",
    "2. *Environment*: The environment used in this exmaple is part of OpenAI Gym, corresponding to the version of the cart-pole problem described by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson [1]\n",
    "3. *State*: Cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole velocity at tip\t\n",
    "4. *Action*: Push cart to the left, push cart to the right\n",
    "5. *Reward*: Reward is 1 for every step taken, including the termination step\n",

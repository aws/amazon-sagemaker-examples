    "## SageMaker Training Compiler Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker Training Compiler is a capability of SageMaker that makes hard-to-implement optimizations to reduce training time on GPU instances. The compiler optimizes Deep Learning (DL) models to accelerate training by more efficiently using SageMaker machine learning (ML) GPU instances. SageMaker Training Compiler is available at no additional charge within SageMaker and can help reduce total billable time as it accelerates training. \n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker Training Compiler is integrated into the AWS Deep Learning Containers (DLCs). Using the SageMaker Training Compiler enabled AWS DLCs, you can compile and optimize training jobs on GPU instances with minimal changes to your code. Bring your deep learning models to SageMaker and enable SageMaker Training Compiler to accelerate the speed of your training job on SageMaker ML instances for accelerated computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see [SageMaker Training Compiler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/training-compiler.html) in the *Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, you'll use Amazon SageMaker Training Compiler to train the `Vision Transformer` model on the `Caltech-256` dataset. To get started, we need to set up the environment with a few prerequisite steps, for permissions, configurations, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** You can run this demo in SageMaker Studio, SageMaker notebook instances, or your local machine with AWS CLI set up. If using SageMaker Studio or SageMaker notebook instances, make sure you choose one of the TensorFlow-based kernels, `Python 3 (TensorFlow x.y Python 3.x CPU Optimized)` or `conda_tensorflow_p39` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This notebook uses a `ml.p3.8xlarge` instance with 4 GPUs. If you don't have enough quota, see [Request a service quota increase for SageMaker resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/regions-quotas.html#service-limit-increase-request-procedure). "

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor continuously monitors the quality of Amazon SageMaker machine learning models in production. It enables developers to set alerts for when there are deviations in the model quality. Early and pro-active detection of these deviations enables corrective actions, such as retraining models, auditing upstream systems, or fixing data quality issues without having to monitor models manually or build additional tooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Clarify bias monitoring helps data scientists and ML engineers monitor predictions for bias on a regular basis. One way bias can be introduced in deployed ML models is when the data used in training differs from the data used to generate predictions. This is especially pronounced if the data used for training changes over time (e.g. fluctuating mortgage rates), and the model prediction will not be accurate unless the model is retrained with updated data. For example, model for predicting home prices can be biased if the mortgage rates used to train the model differ from the most current real-world mortgage rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aamazon SageMaker Clarify explainability monitoring offers tools to provide global explanations of models and to explain the predictions of a deployed model producing inferences. Such model explanation tools can help ML modelers and developers and other internal stakeholders understand model characteristics as a whole prior to deployment and to debug predictions provided by the model once deployed. The current offering includes a scalable and efficient implementation of [SHAP](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions), based on the concept of the [Shapley value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value) from the field of cooperative game theory that assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the model is monitored, customers can view exportable reports and graphs detailing bias and feature attributions in SageMaker Studio and configure alerts in Amazon CloudWatch to receive notifications if violations are detected."

    "\n",
    "To get started, make sure these prerequisites completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specify an AWS Region to host the model.\n",
    "* An IAM role ARN exists that is used to give Amazon SageMaker access to data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). See the documentation for how to fine tune the permissions needed. \n",
    "* Create an S3 bucket used to store the test dataset, any additional model data, data captured from model invocations and ground truth data. For demonstration purposes, this notebook uses the same bucket for these. In reality, they could be separated with different security policies."

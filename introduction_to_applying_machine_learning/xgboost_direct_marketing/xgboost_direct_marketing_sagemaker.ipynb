    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",

    "* Oddly distributed data: Although for non-linear models like Gradient Boosted Trees, this has very limited implications, parametric models like regression can produce wildly inaccurate estimates when fed highly skewed data.  In some cases, simply taking the natural log of the features is sufficient to produce more normally distributed data.  In others, bucketing values into discrete ranges is helpful.  These buckets can then be treated as categorical variables and included in the model when one hot encoded.\n",

This last part is key, as frequently in their quest for greater accuracy, machine learning models bias themselves toward picking up on minor idiosyncrasies within the data they are shown.

In order to improve predictive accuracy further, we could tweak value we threshold our predictions at to alter the mix of false-positives and false-negatives, or we could explore techniques like hyperparameter tuning.  In a real-world scenario, we would also spend more time engineering features by hand and would likely look for additional datasets to include which contain customer information not available in our initial dataset."

    "This notebook is one of a sequence of notebooks that show you how to use various SageMaker functionalities to build, train, and deploy the model from end to end, including data pre-processing steps like ingestion, cleaning and processing, feature engineering, training and hyperparameter tuning, model explainability, and eventually deploy the model. There are two parts of the demo: \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Customer Churn and why is it important for businesses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn, or customer retention/attrition, means a customer has the tendency to leave and stop paying for a business. It is one of the primary metrics companies want to track to get a sense of their customer satisfaction, especially for a subscription-based business model. The company can track churn rate (defined as the percentage of customers churned during a period) as a health indicator for the business, but we would love to identify the at-risk customers before they churn and offer appropriate treatment to keep them with the business, and this is where machine learning comes into play.\n",
    "### Use Cases for Customer Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "Any subscription-based business would track customer churn as one of the most critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Such companies and industries include Telecom companies (cable, cell phone, internet, etc.), digital subscriptions of media (news, forums, blogposts platforms, etc.), music and video streaming services, and other Software as a Service (SaaS) providers (e-commerce, CRM, Mar-Tech, cloud computing, video conference provider, and visualization and data science tools, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Business problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, here are some common business problems to consider depending on your specific use cases and your focus:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Will this customer churn (cancel the plan, cancel the subscription)?\n",
    " * Will this customer downgrade a pricing plan?\n",
    " * For a subscription business model, will a customer renew his/her subscription?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification: will this customer churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "To goal of classification is to identify the at-risk customers and sometimes their unusual behavior, such as: will this customer churn or downgrade their plan? Is there any unusual behavior for a customer? The latter question can be formulated as an anomaly detection problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Series: will this customer churn in the next X months? When will this customer churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further explore your users by formulating the problem as a time series one and detect when will the customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data collection Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Some most common data sources used to construct a data set for churn analysis are:\n",
    "* Customer Relationship Management platform (CRM), \n",
    "* engagement and usage data (analytics services), \n",
    "* passive feedback (ratings based on your request), and active feedback (customer support request, feedback on social media and review platforms).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Construct a Data Set for Churn Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Most raw data collected from the sources mentioned above are huge and often needs a lot of cleaning and pre-processing. For example, usage data is usually event-based log data and can be more than a few gigabytes every day; you can aggregate the data to user-level daily for further analysis. Feedback and review data are mostly text data, so you would need to clean and pre-process the natural language data to be normalized, machine-readable data. If you are joining multiple data sources (especially from different platforms) together, you would want to make sure all data points are consistent, and the user identity can be matched across different platforms.\n",
    "           \n",
    "#### Challenges with Customer Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "* Business related\n",
    "    * Importance of domain knowledge: this is critical when you start building features for the machine learning model. It is important to understand the business enough to decide which features would trigger retention.\n",
    "* Data issues\n",
    "    * fewer churn data available (imbalanced classes): data for churn analysis is often very imbalanced as most of the customers of a business are happy customers (usually).\n",
    "    * User identity mapping problem: if you are joining data from different platforms (CRM, email, feedback, mobile app, and website usage data), you would want to make sure user A is recognized as the same user across multiple platforms. There are third-party solutions that help you tackle this problem.\n",
    "    * Not collecting the right data for the use case or Lacking enough data"

    "## Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "You can experiment with all your model choices and see which one gives better results. A few things to note when you choose algorithms:\n",
    "* **Start with simple ones**: Usually for tabular data classification that does not contain complex unstructured data (text, audio, image, etc.), you can start with logistic regression to see how your data performs, as sometimes the simplest model gives great results if your data have a strong linear pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Think about your data structure**: For imbalanced class data like churn analysis, you can experiment with tree-based models like the random forest, gradient boosting, or XGboost since they are less sensitive to class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpretability**: logistic regression model generally has better interpretability because of its linearity. You can also use feature importance from tree-based models or Support Vector Machines as an overall observation, but not to your predicting instance level. Instead, you can utilize tools like SHAP or the SageMaker new feature SageMaker Clarify to better visualize which feature contributing more to your prediction results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use case, a tree-based model XGBoost is chosen due to consideration of imbalanced class, and in the family of tree based models, XGBoost usually gives best results as its built for model performance and computational speed. "

For a imbalanced classification problem, you can choose F1 as your evaluation especially for comparing different models;  area under curve (auc) is also a good choice when your output is probability.\n",

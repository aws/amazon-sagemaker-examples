    "When ingesting structured data from an existing S3 bucket into a SageMaker Notebook, there are multiple ways to handle it. We will introduce the following methods to access your data from the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Copying your data to your instance. If you are dealing with a normal size of data or are simply experimenting, you can copy the files into the SageMaker instance and just use it as a file system in your local machine. \n",
    "* Using Python packages to directly access your data without copying it. One downside of copying your data to your instance is: if you are done with your notebook instance and delete it, all the data is gone with it unless you store it elsewhere. We will introduce several methods to solve this problem in this notebook, and using python packages is one of them. Also, if you have large data sets (for example, with millions of rows), you can directly read data from S3 utilizing S3 compatible python libraries with built-in functions.\n",
    "* Using AWS native methods to directly access your data. You can also use AWS native packages like `s3fs` and `aws data wrangler` to access your data directly.  \n",

    "The [Boston House](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) contains  information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. We will use the data set to showcase how to ingest tabular data into S3, and for further pre-processing and feature engineering. The dataset contains the following columns (506 rows):\n",
    "* `CRIM` - per capita crime rate by town\n",
    "* `ZN` - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n",
    "* `INDUS` - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.\n",

    "* `NOX` - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n",
    "* `RM` - average number of rooms per dwelling\n",
    "* `AGE` - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n",
    "* `DIS` - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres\n",
    "* `RAD` - index of accessibility to radial highways\n",
    "* `TAX` - full-value property-tax rate per \\$10,000\n",
    "* `PTRATIO` - pupil-teacher ratio by town\n",

    "When you are dealing with large data sets, or do not want to lose any data when you delete your SageMaker Notebook Instance, you can use pre-built packages to access your files in S3 without copying files into your instance. These packages, such as `Pandas`, have implemented options to access data with a specified path string: while you will use `file://` on your local file system, you will use `s3://` instead to access the data through the AWS boto library. For `pandas`, any valid string path is acceptable. The string could be a URL. Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, and file. For file URLs, a host is expected.You can find additional documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html). "

It is built on top of other open-source projects like Pandas, Apache Arrow, Boto3, s3fs, SQLAlchemy, Psycopg2 and PyMySQL, and offers abstracted functions to execute usual ETL tasks like load/unload data from Data Lakes, Data Warehouses and Databases. Note that you would need `s3fs version > 0.4.0` for the `awswrangler csv reader` to work."

    "\n",
    "Amazon Elastic Inference (EI) is a resource you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instances to accelerate your deep learning (DL) inference workloads. EI allows you to add inference acceleration to an Amazon SageMaker hosted endpoint or Jupyter notebook for a fraction of the cost of using a full GPU instance. For more information please visit: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ei.html\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an adaption of the [SageMaker MXNet MNIST notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/aws_sagemaker_studio/frameworks/mxnet_mnist/mxnet_mnist.ipynb), with modifications showing the changes needed to enable and use EI with MXNet on SageMaker.\n",

    "\n",
    "### MNIST dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST dataset is widely used for handwritten digit classification, and consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). The task at hand is to train a model using the 60,000 training images and then test its classification accuracy on the 10,000 test images.\n",

Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the `sagemaker.get_execution_role()` with a the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

    "# IAM Role\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we review the concept of IAM role and set up one to be used for later notebooks in `/sagemaker-fundamentals`. An IAM role is an identity associated with your AWS account that has pre-configured permission policies that determine what this role can do and with respect to your AWS resources. For example, you can define a role that can do *everything* to your S3 resource but nothing else. Such an role is useful if it is *assumed* by a program that synchronize your data from your local machine to an S3 bucket. You can be certain that this program would not accidently create EC2 instances that incur higher costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "One application of IAM role is: it grants permissions to AWS services (e.g. SageMaker) to procure resources on your behalf. When you use an AWS service(e.g. SageMaker), you can define a role that the service can assume on your behalf to access the AWS resources. For example, SageMaker service needs to access S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Elastic Container Registries etc. To avoid incurring too much compute cost, you can define a role that is able to create only low cost EC2 instances. When SageMaker assumes this role and runs your ML workflow, you can estimate the upper bound of the compute cost based on the EC2 policy of the role. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more extensive readings on IAM role, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-role-chaining)"

    "## Environments to run this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are running this notebook from an EC2 instance, then you need to make sure `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable is set to `default`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you are running this notebook on your local machine, you will need to install and configure aws command line interface. Follow [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IAM user/role running this notebook should at least have `iam:CreateRole` and `iam:DeleteRole` and `sts:AssumeRole` permission. \n",
    "\n",
    "I do not recommend to run it on an SageMaker Notebook Instance or Studio, because they automatically created an IAM role for you and the whole point of this notebook is to create one manually from scratch. \n",

You can build our own docker container with Python3, [Boto3 SDK](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) and [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) installs, so that you can make use of them to make calls to Amazon Fraud Detector APIs via the AWS Boto3 library and access SageMaker constructs, such as Feature Store via custom data processing scripts."

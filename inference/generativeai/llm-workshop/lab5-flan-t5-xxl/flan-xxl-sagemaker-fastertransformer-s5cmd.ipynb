    "In this notebook, we explore how to host a FLAN-T5-XXL large language model with FP32 precision on SageMaker using the NVIDIA Faster Transformer. We use DJLServing as the model serving solution in this example. DJLServing is a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by the Deep Java Library (DJL) that is programming language agnostic. To learn more about DJL and DJLServing, you can refer to our recent blog post (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-bloom-176b-and-opt-30b-on-amazon-sagemaker-with-large-model-inference-deep-learning-containers-and-deepspeed/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Model parallelism can help deploy large models that would normally be too large for a single GPU. With model parallelism, we partition and distribute a model across multiple GPUs. Each GPU holds a different part of the model, resolving the memory capacity issue for the largest deep learning models with billions of parameters. This notebook uses tensor parallelism techniques which allow GPUs to work simultaneously on the same layer of a model and achieve low latency inference relative to a pipeline parallel solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker has rolled out DeepSpeed container which now provides users with the ability to leverage the managed serving capabilities and help to provide the un-differentiated heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we deploy the open source [FLAN-T5-XXL](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) model across GPUs on a ml.g5.12xlarge instance for efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Flan-T5 are T5 models trained on the Flan collection of datasets which include: taskmaster2, djaym7/wiki_dialog, deepmind/code_contests, lambada, gsm8k, aqua_rat, esnli, quasc and qed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[FasterTransformer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer) implements a highly optimized transformer layer for both the encoder and decoder for inference. On Volta, Turing and Ampere GPUs, the computing power of Tensor Cores are used automatically when the precision of the data and weights are FP16.\n",
    "\n",
    "FasterTransformer is built on top of CUDA, cuBLAS, cuBLASLt and C++. We provide at least one API of the following frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch and Triton backend. Users can integrate FasterTransformer into these frameworks directly. For supporting frameworks, we also provide example codes to demonstrate how to use, and show the performance on these frameworks\n"

    "Customer: Okay, will I have to pay for the repairs?\n",
    "Agent: That depends on whether your iPhone is covered under warranty or not. If it is, you won't have to pay anything. However, if it's not covered under warranty, you will have to pay for the repairs.\n",
    "Customer: How long will it take to get my iPhone back?\n",

    "Agent: No problem, happy to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\n",

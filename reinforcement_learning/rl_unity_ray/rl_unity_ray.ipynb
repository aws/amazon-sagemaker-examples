    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Unity](https://unity.com/) is currently the most popular gaming engine used by game developers around the world. Unity engine can be used to create 3D, 2D, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) is an open-sourced toolkit developed by Unity to enable games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. It provides capabilities on how to interact with Unity executables as well as how to train a RL agent. For how to use ML-Agents to train a Unity game agent on SageMaker, please refer to this [notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/unity_ml_agents/unity_mlagents_learn.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are using capabilities from ML-Agent to interact with Unity executables, but leveraging Amazon SageMaker RL to train the game agent. We will show how you can apply reinforcement learning to train an agent to play against a Unity game with Amazon SageMaker RL."

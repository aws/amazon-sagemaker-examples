    "* Host a machine learning model in Amazon SageMaker and capture inference requests, results, and metadata \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly. Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that encompasses the entire machine learning workflow. You can label and prepare your data, choose an algorithm, train a model, and then tune and optimize it for deployment. You can deploy your models to production with Amazon SageMaker to make predictions and lower costs than was previously possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Amazon SageMaker enables you to capture the input, output and metadata for invocations of the models that you deploy. It also enables you to analyze the data and monitor its quality. In this notebook, you learn how Amazon SageMaker enables these capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, make sure you have these prerequisites completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specify an AWS Region to host your model.\n",
    "* An IAM role ARN exists that is used to give Amazon SageMaker access to your data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). See the documentation for how to fine tune the permissions needed. \n",
    "* Create an S3 bucket used to store the data used to train your model, any additional model data, and the data captured from model invocations. For demonstration purposes, you are using the same bucket for these. In reality, you might want to separate them with different security policies."

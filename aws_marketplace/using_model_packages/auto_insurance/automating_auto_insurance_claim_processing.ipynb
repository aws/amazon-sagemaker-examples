    "## Goal: Automate Auto Insurance Claim Processing Using Pre-trained Models \n",
    "Auto insurance claim process requires extracting metadata from images and performing validations to ensure that the claim is not fraudulent. This sample notebook shows how third party pre-trained machine learning models can be used to extract such metadata from images.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses [Vehicle Damage Inspection](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Persistent-Systems-Vehicle-Damage-Inspection/prodview-xhj66rbazm6oe) model to identify the type of damage and [Deep Vision vehicle recognition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-a7wgrolhu54ts?qid=1558356141251&sr=0-4&ref_=srh_res_product_title) to identify the make, model, year, and bounding box of the car. This notebook also shows how to use the bounding box to extract license information from the using [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-requisites:\n",
    "This sample notebook requires subscription to following pre-trained machine learning model packages from AWS Marketplace:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Vehicle Damage Inspection](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Persistent-Systems-Vehicle-Damage-Inspection/prodview-xhj66rbazm6oe)\n",
    "2. [Deep Vision vehicle recognition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-a7wgrolhu54ts?qid=1558356141251&sr=0-4&ref_=srh_res_product_title)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your AWS account has not been subscribed to these listings, here is the process you can follow for each of the above mentioned listings:\n",
    "1. Open the listing from AWS Marketplace\n",
    "2. Read the **Highlights** section and then **product overview** section of the listing.\n",
    "3. View **usage information** and then **additional resources**.\n",
    "4. Note the supported instance types.\n",
    "5. Next, click on **Continue to subscribe**.\n",
    "6. Review **End user license agreement**, **support terms**, as well as **pricing information**.\n",
    "7. **\"Accept Offer\"** button needs to be clicked if your organization agrees with EULA, pricing information as well as support terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**: \n",
    "1. If **Continue to configuration** button is active, it means your account already has a subscription to this listing.\n",
    "2. Once you click on **Continue to configuration** button and then choose region, you will see that a **Product Arn** will appear. This is the model package ARN that you need to specify while creating a deployable model. However, for this notebook, the algorithm ARN has been specified in **src/model_package_arns.py** file and you do not need to specify the same explicitly.\n"

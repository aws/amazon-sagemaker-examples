    "Amazon SageMaker LDA is an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to describe a set of observations as a mixture of distinct categories. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is most commonly used to discover a user-specified number of topics shared by documents within a text corpus. Here each observation is a document, the features are the presence (or occurrence count) of each word, and the categories are the topics. Since the method is unsupervised, the topics are not specified up front, and are not guaranteed to align with how a human may naturally categorize documents. The topics are learned as a probability distribution over the words that occur in each document. Each document, in turn, is described as a mixture of topics."

    "\n",
    "We denote a *document* by a vector $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^V$ where $w_i$ equals the number of times the $i$th word in the vocabulary occurs within the document. This is called the \"bag-of-words\" format of representing a document. The *length* of a document is equal to the total number of words in the document: $N_w = \\sum_{i=1}^V w_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An LDA model is defined by two parameters: a topic-word distribution matrix $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times V}$ and a  Dirichlet topic prior $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$. In particular, let,\n",

    "be a collection of $K$ *topics* where each topic $\\beta_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^V$ is represented as probability distribution over the vocabulary. One of the utilities of the LDA model is that a given word is allowed to appear in multiple topics with positive probability. The Dirichlet topic prior is a vector $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ such that $\\alpha_k > 0$ for all $k$."

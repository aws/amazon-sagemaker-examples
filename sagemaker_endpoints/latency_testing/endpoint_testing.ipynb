    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how the inference latency of the same model varies when one model is served with [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [SageMaker pre-built container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html). In all cases, we use a [decision tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) algorithm from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package which is trained on the famous [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). \n",
    "\n",
    "The scripts and this notebook can be used to load test and compare latency for any endpoint that you deploy on SageMaker. You can either test a [pre-built SageMaker container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/docker-containers-prebuilt.html) or [bring your own container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor-byoc-containers.html). [This GitHub repo](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/main/advanced_functionality/scikit_bring_your_own) provides a more detailed example on how to bring your own container to SageMaker"

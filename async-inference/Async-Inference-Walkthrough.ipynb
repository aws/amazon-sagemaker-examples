    "Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous Inference is a new capability in SageMaker that queues incoming requests and processes them asynchronously. SageMaker currently offers two inference options for customers to deploy machine learning models: 1) a real-time option for low-latency workloads 2) Batch transform, an offline option to process inference requests on batches of data available upfront. Real-time inference is suited for workloads with payload sizes of less than 6 MB and require inference requests to be processed within 60 seconds. Batch transform is suitable for offline inference on batches of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous inference is a new inference option for near real-time inference needs. Requests can take up to 15 minutes to process and have payload sizes of up to 1 GB. Asynchronous inference is suitable for workloads that do not have sub-second latency requirements and have relaxed latency requirements. For example, you might need to process an inference on a large image of several MBs within 5 minutes. In addition, asynchronous inference endpoints let you control costs by scaling down endpoints instance count to zero when they are idle, so you only pay when your endpoints are processing requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook scope <a id='scope'></a>  \n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to the SageMaker Asynchronous inference capability. This notebook will cover the steps required to create an asynchronous inference endpoint and test it with some sample requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview and sample end to end flow <a id='overview'></a>\n",
    "Asynchronous inference endpoints have many similarities (and some key differences) compared to real-time endpoints. The process to create asynchronous endpoints is similar to real-time endpoints. You need to create: a model, an endpoint configuration, and then an endpoint. However, there are specific configuration parameters specific to asynchronous inference endpoints which we will explore below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Invocation of asynchronous endpoints differ from real-time endpoints. Rather than pass request payload inline with the request, you upload the payload to Amazon S3 and pass an Amazon S3 URI as a part of the request. Upon receiving the request, SageMaker provides you with a token with the output location where the result will be placed once processed. Internally, SageMaker maintains a queue with these requests and processes them. During endpoint creation, you can optionally specify an Amazon SNS topic to receive success or error notifications. Once you receive the notification that your inference request has been successfully processed, you can access the result in the output Amazon S3 location. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below provides a visual overview of the end-to-end flow with Asynchronous inference endpoint."

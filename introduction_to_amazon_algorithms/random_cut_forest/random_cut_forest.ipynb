    "We used Amazon SageMaker Random Cut Forest to detect anomalous datapoints in a taxi ridership dataset. In these data the anomalies occurred when ridership was uncharacteristically high or low. However, the RCF algorithm is also capable of detecting when, for example, data breaks periodicity or uncharacteristically changes global behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the kind of data you have there are several ways to improve algorithm performance. One method, for example, is to use an appropriate training set. If you know that a particular set of data is characteristic of \"normal\" behavior then training on said set of data will more accurately characterize \"abnormal\" data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another improvement is make use of a windowing technique called \"shingling\". This is especially useful when working with periodic data with known period, such as the NYC taxi dataset used above. The idea is to treat a period of $P$ datapoints as a single datapoint of feature length $P$ and then run the RCF algorithm on these feature vectors. That is, if our original data consists of points $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N \\in \\mathbb{R}$ then we perform the transformation,\n",

    "We see that with this particular shingle size, hyperparameter selection, and anomaly cutoff threshold that the shingled approach more clearly captures the major anomalous events: the spike at around t=6000 and the dip at around t=10000. In general, the number of trees, sample size, and anomaly score cutoff are all parameters that a data scientist may need experiment with in order to achieve desired results.

    "In this notebook, we explore how to host a large language model on SageMaker using the [Large Model Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-large-model-inference.html) container that is optimized for hosting large models using DJLServing. DJLServing is a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by the Deep Java Library (DJL) that is programming language agnostic. To learn more about DJL and DJLServing, you can refer to our recent [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-large-models-on-amazon-sagemaker-using-djlserving-and-deepspeed-model-parallel-inference/).\n",

    "Language models have recently exploded in both size and popularity. In 2018, BERT-large entered the scene and, with its 340M parameters and novel transformer architecture, set the standard on NLP task accuracy. Within just a few years, state-of-the-art NLP model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and similarly sized open source Bloom 176B raising the bar on NLP accuracy. This increase in the number of parameters is driven by the simple and empirically-demonstrated positive relationship between model size and accuracy: more is better. With easy access from models zoos such as Hugging Face and improved accuracy in NLP tasks such as classification and text generation, practitioners are increasingly reaching for these large models. However, deploying them can be a challenge because of their size.\n",

    "1. `engine` - specifies the engine that will be used for this workload. In this case we'll be hosting a model using the [DJL Python Engine](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-serving/tree/master/engines/python)\n",
    "2. `option.entryPoint` - specifies the entrypoint code that will be used to host the model. djl_python.huggingface refers to the `huggingface.py` module from [djl_python repo](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-serving/tree/master/engines/python/setup/djl_python).  \n",
    "3. `option.s3url` - specifies the location of the model files. Alternativelly an `option.model_id` option can be used instead to specifiy a model from Hugging Face Hub (e.g. `EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B`) and the model will be automatically downloaded from the Hub. The s3url approach is recommended as it allows you to host the model artifact within your own environment and enables faster deployments by utilizing optimized approach within the DJL inference container to transfer the model from S3 into the hosting instance \n",
    "4. `option.task` - This is specific to the `huggingface.py` inference handler and specifies for which task this model will be used\n",
    "5. `option.device_map` - Enables layer-wise model partitioning through [Hugging Face Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/big_modeling#designing-a-device-map). With `option.device_map=auto`, Accelerate will determine where to put each **layer** to maximize the use of your fastest devices (GPUs) and offload the rest on the CPU, or even the hard drive if you don’t have enough GPU RAM (or CPU RAM). Even if the model is split across several devices, it will run as you would normally expect.\n",
    "6. `option.load_in_8bit` - Quantizes the model weights to int8 thereby greatly reducing the memory footprint of the model from the initial FP32. See this [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration) from Hugging Face for additional information \n",

    "\n",
    "Our initial approach here is to utilize the built-in functionality within Hugging Face Transformers to enable Large Language Model hosting. These are exposed through the `device_map` and `load_in_8bit` parameters which enable sharding and shrinking of the model. The sharding approach taken here is layer wise as individual model layers are placed onto different GPU devices and data flows sequentially from the input to the final output layer as illustated below<br>\n",

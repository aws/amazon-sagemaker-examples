    "# Hosting a Pretrained Model on SageMaker\n",
    "    \n",
    "Amazon SageMaker is a service to accelerate the entire machine learning lifecycle. It includes components for building, training and deploying machine learning models. Each SageMaker component is modular, so you're welcome to only use the features needed for your use case. One of the most popular features of SageMaker is [model hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-deployment.html). Using SageMaker Hosting you can deploy your model as a scalable, highly available, multi-process API endpoint with a few lines of code. In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to host a pretrained model (BERT) in Amazon SageMaker to extract embeddings from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker provides prebuilt containers that can be used for training, hosting, or data processing. The inference containers include a web serving stack, so you don't need to install and configure one. We will be using the SageMaker [PyTorch container](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers), but you may use the [TensorFlow container](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md), or bring your own container if needed.  \n",

Minimally, it will need read access to the default SageMaker bucket (usually named sagemaker-{region}-{your account ID}) so it can read the deployment package.

### SageMaker JumpStart Question Answering Training & Deployment
This notebook `Amazon_JumpStart_Question_Answering.ipynb` for Extractive Question Answering task demonstrates (a) how to use a pre-trained model available in JumpStart for inference, and (b) how to fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer model on a custom dataset using JumpStart transfer learning algorithm with AMT (Automatic Model Tuning) to search for the best hyperparameters, and how to use the fine-tuned model for inference.

    "# Game servers autopilot\n",
    "Multiplayer game publishers often need to either over-provision resources or manually manage compute resource allocation when launching a large-scale worldwide game, to avoid the long player-wait in the game lobby. Game publishers need to develop, config, and deploy tools that helped them to monitor and control the compute allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates Game server autopilot, a new machine learning-based example tool that makes it easy for game publishers to reduce the time players wait for compute to spawn, while still avoiding compute over-provisioning. It also eliminates manual configuration decisions and changes publishers need to make and reduces the opportunity for human errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We heard from customers that optimizing compute resource allocation is not trivial. This is because it often takes substantial time to allocate and prepare EC2 instances. The time needed to spin up an EC2 instance and install game binaries and other assets must be learned and accounted for in the allocation algorithm. Ever-changing usage patterns require a model that is adaptive to emerging player habits. Finally, the system also performs scale down in concert with new server allocation as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe a reinforcement learning-based system that learns to allocate resources in response to player usage patterns. The hosted model directly predicts the required number of game-servers so as to allow EKS the time to allocate instances to reduce player wait time. The training process integrates with the game eco-system, and requires minimal manual configuration."

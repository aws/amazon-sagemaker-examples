    "# Compile and Deploy a TensorFlow model on Inf1 instances\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker now supports Inf1 instances for high performance and cost-effective inferences. Inf1 instances are ideal for large scale machine learning inference applications like image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, personalization, and fraud detection. In this example, we train a classification model on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow, compile it using Amazon SageMaker Neo, and deploy the model on Inf1 instances on a SageMaker endpoint and use the Neo Deep Learning Runtime to make inferences in real-time and with low latency. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inf 1 instances \n",
    "Inf1 instances are built from the ground up to support machine learning inference applications and feature up to 16 AWS Inferentia chips, high-performance machine learning inference chips designed and built by AWS. The Inferentia chips are coupled with the latest custom 2nd generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and up to 100 Gbps networking to enable high throughput inference. With 1 to 16 AWS Inferentia chips per instance, Inf1 instances can scale in performance to up to 2000 Tera Operations per Second (TOPS) and deliver extremely low latency for real-time inference applications. The large on-chip memory on AWS Inferentia chips used in Inf1 instances allows caching of machine learning models directly on the chip. This eliminates the need to access outside memory resources during inference, enabling low latency without impacting bandwidth. \n"

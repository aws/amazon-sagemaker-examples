    "Portfolio management is the process of constant redistribution of a capital into a set of different financial assets. Given the historic prices of a list of stocks and current portfolio allocation, the goal is to maximize the return while restraining the risk. In this demo, we use a reinforcement learning framework to manage the portfolio by continuously reallocating several stocks. Based on the setup in [1], we use a tensor input constructed from historical price data, and then apply an actor-critic policy gradient algorithm to accommodate the continuous actions (reallocations). The customized environment is constructed using Open AI Gym and the RL agents are trained using Amazon SageMaker.  \n",

    "\n",
    "We start with $m$ preselected stocks. Without loss of generality, the total investment value is set as 1 dollar at the initial timestamp. At timestamp $t$, letting $v_{m,t}$ denote the closing price of stock $m$, the *price relative vector* is defined as \n",

    "The first element corresponds to the cash we maintain. The cash value doesn't change along time so it is always 1.

    "Training machine learning models is a time and compute intensive process requiring multiple training runs with different hyperparameters before a model yields acceptable accuracy. CPU and GPU based distributed training with\n",
    "frameworks such as Horovord and Parameter Servers address this issue by allowing training to be easily\n",
    "scalable to a cluster of resources. However, distributed training makes it harder to identify and debug\n",
    "resource bottleneck problems. Gaining insights into the training in progress, both at the machine learning\n",
    "framework level and the underlying compute resources level, is critical step towards understanding the\n",
    "resource usage patterns and reducing resource wastage. Analyzing bottleneck issues is necessary to\n",
    "maximize the utilization of compute resources and optimize model training performance to deliver state-of-the-art machine learning models with target accuracy.\n",

    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy ML models at scale. Amazon SageMaker Debugger is a feature of SageMaker training that makes it easy to train machine learning (ML) models faster by capturing real-time metrics such as learning gradients and weights, providing transparency into the training process, so you can correct anomalies such as losses, overfitting, and overtraining. With the newly introduced profiling capability, SageMaker Debugger now automatically monitors system resources such as CPU, GPU, network, IO, and memory providing a complete resource utilization view of training jobs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a very common text analytics task that involves determining whether a text sample is positive or negative about its subject.  There are several different algorithms for performing this task, including statistical algorithms and deep learning algorithms.  With respect to deep learning, a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) is sometimes used for this purpose.  In this notebook we'll use a CNN built with TensorFlow to perform sentiment analysis in Amazon SageMaker on the IMDB dataset, which consists of movie reviews labeled as having positive or negative sentiment."

This notebook provided insight into training resource utilization to identify bottlenecks, analysis of various phases of training and identifying expensive framework functions. The notebook also demonstrated how to analyze and implement profiler recommendations. Applying profiler recommendations to a Tensorflow Horovord distributed training for a sentiment analysis model, we achieved resource utilization improvement upto 36% and up to 83% cost savings."

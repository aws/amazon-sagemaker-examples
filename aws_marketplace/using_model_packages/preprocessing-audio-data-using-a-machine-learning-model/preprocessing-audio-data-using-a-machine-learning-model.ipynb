    "Training models on real life audio datasets can be challenging. Often, these datasets have noise from the environment that distorts the signal in the audio and this can affect the quality of the models that are trained on such datasets. Cleaning the dataset using traditional methods like filtering based on signal's characteristics like spectral energy, amplitude, frequency, etc is complicated and consumes a lot of time that often involves a lot of trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes machine Learning models that are trained to identify and separate the different components(like background and foreground, vocals and accompaniment, etc) in an audio file can be used to generate synthetic features or to clean the original audio dataset. The [Quantiphi Source Separation Model](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-23n4vi2zw67we?ref_=sa_campaign_pinaksaurabh) is one such model that performs source separation in the time domain of the input source audio. It uses a convolutional neural network like a U-Net in the time domain to separate the background noise and the main signal in an input audio.\n",

    "In this sample notebook, you will see how to use this model to process original audio files and then use the output of the model to train other downstream models. The performance of the downstream models is often better than one that has been trained on the original audio data."

    "\n",
    "Industrial machinery are often termed as critical equipments in the process and are prone to failure or breakdown, resulting in significant expenses for companies. There is a lot of value in monitoring these machines using different sensors including microphones. Advancements in acoustic detection methods as well as algorithms that aid in classification of scenes and events can now be used to monitor them. In this notebook, you will use a existing dataset of industrial machine sounds that contains sounds of normal and malfunctioning industrial machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology can be applied to various real-life scenarios where anomalous sounds are recorded (e.g., contamination, leakage, rotating unbalance, and rail damage). The purpose of this notebook is to use a pre-trained machine learning model and show if it can contribute to achieve better performance in acoustic classification based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [step 1](#-Step-1-Download-the-MIMII-dataset) of this notebook, you will download the dataset that is used in the notebook. In [step 2](#Step-2:-Use-an-ML-model-to-preprocess-the-audio-data), you will create the model from an AWS Marketplace subscription, deploy to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint and use it to preprocess the original audio files. In [step 3](#Step-3:-Explore-the-output-from-the-source-separation-model), you will explore the output of the model and see some examples. In [step 4](#Step-4:-Build-a-classification-model-to-identify-anomalous-samples), you will build classification models to identify anomalous samples. In [Step 5](#Step-5-Compare-the-performance-of-the-models) you will compare the performance of the models.\n"

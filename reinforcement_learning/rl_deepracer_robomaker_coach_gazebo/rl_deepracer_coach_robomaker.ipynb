    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will train a fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car using reinforcement learning using Amazon SageMaker RL and AWS RoboMaker's 3D driving simulator. [AWS RoboMaker](https://console.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/home#welcome) is a service that makes it easy for developers to develop, test, and deploy robotics applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a jailbreak experience of [AWS DeepRacer](https://console.aws.amazon.com/deepracer/home#welcome), giving us more control over the training/simulation process and RL algorithm tuning.\n",

    "\n",
    "The reinforcement learning agent (i.e. our autonomous car) learns to drive by interacting with its environment, e.g., the track, by taking an action in a given state to maximize the expected reward. The agent learns the optimal plan of actions in training by trial-and-error through repeated episodes.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The figure above shows an example of distributed RL training across SageMaker and two RoboMaker simulation envrionments that perform the **rollouts** - execute a fixed number of episodes using the current model or policy. The rollouts collect agent experiences (state-transition tuples) and share this data with SageMaker for training. SageMaker updates the model policy which is then used to execute the next sequence of rollouts. This training loop continues until the model converges, i.e. the car learns to drive and stops going off-track. More formally, we can define the problem in terms of the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective**: Learn to drive autonomously by staying close to the center of the track.\n",
    "2. **Environment**: A 3D driving simulator hosted on AWS RoboMaker.\n",
    "3. **State**: The driving POV image captured by the car's head camera, as shown in the illustration above.\n",
    "4. **Action**: Six discrete steering wheel positions at different angles (configurable)\n",
    "5. **Reward**: Positive reward for staying close to the center line; High penalty for going off-track. This is configurable and can be made more complex (for e.g. steering penalty can be added)."

    "Knapsack is a canonical operations research problem. We start with a bag and a set of items. We choose which items to put in the bag. Our objective is to maximize the value of the items in the bag; but we cannot put all the items in as the bag capacity is limited. The problem is hard because the items have different values and weights, and there are many combinations to consider.\n",

If we throw the item away, we get a fixed penalty. In case the bag is too full to accommodate the item, we are forced to throw it away.\n",
    "In the next step, another item appears and we need to decide again if we want to put it in the bag or throw it away.  This process repeats for a fixed number of steps.\n",

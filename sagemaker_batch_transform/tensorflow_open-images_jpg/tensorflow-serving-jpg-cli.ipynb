To do this, we'll use a TensorFlow Serving model to do batch inference on a large dataset of images. We'll show how to use the new pre-processing and post-processing feature of the TensorFlow Serving container on Amazon SageMaker so that your TensorFlow model can make inferences directly on data in S3, and save post-processed inferences to S3.\n",

This subset consists of 100,00 images in .jpg format, for a total of 10GB. For demonstration, the [model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/resnet#pre-trained-model) we'll be using is an image classification model based on the ResNet-50 architecture that has been trained on the ImageNet dataset, and which has been exported as a TensorFlow SavedModel.\n",

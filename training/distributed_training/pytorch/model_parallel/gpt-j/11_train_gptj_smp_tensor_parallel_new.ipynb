[GPT-J 6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) is the 6 billion parameter successor to EleutherAIs GPT-NEO family, a family of transformer-based language models based on the GPT architecture for text generation.\n",

To load it in float32, one would need at least 2x model size CPU RAM: 1x for initial weights and another 1x to load the checkpoint. Apart from the model parameters, there are the gradients, optimizer states, and activations taking memory, so the actual memory usage might be significantly higher than 48GB. Just as an example, with Adam optimizer and FP32 training, the use from parameters, gradients and optimizer states might be 96GB+, and activation memory footprint would be even more than this, so the total memory usage might be easily larger than 200 GB.\n",

    "\n",
    "SageMaker provides distributed training libraries for data parallelism and model parallelism. The libraries are optimized for the SageMaker training environment, help adapt your distributed training jobs to SageMaker, and improve training speed and throughput.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SageMaker Model Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "Model parallelism is the process of splitting a model up between multiple devices or nodes (such as GPU-equipped instances) and creating an efficient pipeline to train the model across these devices to maximize GPU utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing deep learning model size (layers and parameters) can result in better accuracy. However, there is a limit to the maximum model size you can fit in a single GPU. When training deep learning models, GPU memory limitations can be a bottleneck in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They can limit the size of the model you train. Given that larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, this directly translates to trained model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They can limit the batch size you train with, leading to lower GPU utilization and slower training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the limitations associated with training a model on a single GPU, you can use model parallelism to distribute and train your model on multiple computing devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core features of SageMaker Model Parallel \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Automated Model Splitting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-core-features.html): When you use SageMaker's model parallel library, you can take advantage of automated model splitting, also referred to as automated model partitioning. The library uses a partitioning algorithm that balances memory, minimizes communication between devices, and optimizes performance. You can configure the automated partitioning algorithm to optimize for speed or memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Pipeline Execution Schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-core-features.html): A core feature of SageMaker's distributed model parallel library is pipelined execution, which determines the order in which computations are made and data is processed across devices during model training. Pipelining is a technique to achieve true parallelization in model parallelism, by having the GPUs compute simultaneously on different data samples, and to overcome the performance loss due to sequential computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelining is based on splitting a mini-batch into microbatches, which are fed into the training pipeline one-by-one and follow an execution schedule defined by the library runtime. A microbatch is a smaller subset of a given training mini-batch. The pipeline schedule determines which microbatch is executed by which device for every time slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to its [core features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-core-features.html), the SageMaker distributed model parallel library offers [memory-saving features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch.html) for training deep learning models with PyTorch: [tensor parallelism](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-tensor-parallelism.html), [optimizer state sharding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-optimizer-state-sharding.html), [activation checkpointing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-checkpointing.html), and [activation offloading](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-offloading.html).

    "#### SageMaker Tensor Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensor parallelism splits individual layers, or nn.Modules, across devices, to be run in parallel. The following figure shows the simplest example of how the library splits a model with four layers to achieve two-way tensor parallelism (\"tensor_parallel_degree\": 2). The layers of each model replica are bisected and distributed into two GPUs. In this example case, the model parallel configuration also includes \"pipeline_parallel_degree\": 1 and \"ddp\": True (uses PyTorch DistributedDataParallel package in the background), so the degree of data parallelism becomes eight. The library manages communication across the tensor-distributed model replicas.\n",

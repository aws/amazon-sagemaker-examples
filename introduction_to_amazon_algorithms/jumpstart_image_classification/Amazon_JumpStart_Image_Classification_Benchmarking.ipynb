If your [SageMaker service quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sagemaker.html) does not support this many simultaneous training jobs, please do one of the following: 1) request an increase to your SageMaker service quota, 2) adjust the constants `SM_AMT_MAX_PARALLEL_TRAINING_JOBS_PER_TUNER` and `SM_AMT_MAX_PARALLEL_TUNING_JOBS` to comply with your SageMaker service quota, or 3) change this instance type to an instance with a larger default SageMaker service quota, such as `ml.m5.4xlarge`.\n",
    "- __SM_AMT_MAX_JOBS__: Maximum total number of training jobs to start per hyperparameter tuning job.\n",
    "- __SM_AMT_MAX_PARALLEL_TRAINING_JOBS_PER_TUNER__: Maximum number of parallel training jobs per hyperparameter tuning job.\n",
    "- __SM_AMT_MAX_PARALLEL_TUNING_JOBS__: Maximum number of parallel hyperparameter tuning jobs. The resulting maximum number of parallel _training_ jobs is `SM_AMT_MAX_PARALLEL_TRAINING_JOBS_PER_TUNER * SM_AMT_MAX_PARALLEL_TUNING_JOBS`. Please ensure this quantity is less than your SageMaker Training service quota for the specified instance type in your current region.\n",
    "- __SM_AMT_OBJECTIVE_METRIC_NAME__: Name of the metric for evaluating training jobs during model selection. This value is used for early stopping criteria and hyperparameter tuning model selection.\n",
    "- __SM_AMT_OBJECTIVE_TYPE__: The type of the objective metric for evaluating training jobs. This value can be either ‘Minimize’ or ‘Maximize’.\n",
    "- __SM_SESSION__: SageMaker Session object with custom configuration to resolve [SDK rate exceeded and throttling exceptions](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/sagemaker-python-throttlingexception/).\n",
    "- __SM_AMT_HYPERPARAMETER_RANGE_LAMBDA_DICT__: Dictionary of callables that accept a hyperparameter dictionary and return a `sagemaker.parameter.ParameterRange`. These parameter ranges can be one of three types: Continuous, Integer, or Categorical. The keys of the dictionary are the names of the hyperparameter, and the values are callables that produce the appropriate parameter range class to represent the range given a single hyperparameter dictionary argument. This allows AMT hyperparameter range defitions to depend on default model hyperparameter values.\n",
    "- __SM_TRAINING_METRIC_DEFINITIONS__: A list of dictionaries that defines the metric(s) used to evaluate the training jobs. Each dictionary contains two keys: ‘Name’ for the name of the metric, and ‘Regex’ for the regular expression used to extract the metric from the logs. SageMaker JumpStart provides many pre-implemented extractable metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, this notebook provides features to re-attach previously launched training jobs and load previously saved metrics for further analysis. The following constants control this behavior:\n",
    "- __SAVE_TUNING_JOB_NAMES_FILE_PATH__: Path of the [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) file that keeps track of the tuning job name associated with a unique model name and dataset name.\n",

    "With these helper functions established, you can now create a `HyperparameterTuner` object for each specified model. But what happens if there is an error or the kernel for this script is terminated? The hyperparameter tuning jobs would still run to completion, and you do would not want to re-launch these jobs in order to obtain our results. Therefore, you need yet another helper function that will either re-attach the hyperparameter tuning job if it exists or create a new one via `create_benchmarking_tuner`. To accomplish this, the JSON Lines file specified in `SAVE_TUNING_JOB_NAMES_FILE_PATH` is read and checked for whether a tuning job already exists for `model_name` and `dataset_name`. If it does exist, then the job is re-attached and returned. Otherwise, a new tuner is created and the `fit()` method is invoked with the `wait=False` argument and channels specified per the previously defined `S3DatasetSplit` object you used to store our dataset S3 location. You will have the thread wait for this job to complete later, but you first need to put this job information on the `queue_save_tuning_job` queue, which will indicate to the primary thread to append this job information to `SAVE_TUNING_JOB_NAMES_FILE_PATH`.

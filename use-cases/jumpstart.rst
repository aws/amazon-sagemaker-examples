SageMaker Algorithms with Pre-Trained Model Examples by Problem Type
====================================================================

The SageMaker Python SDK provides built-in algorithms with pre-trained models from popular open source model hubs, such as TensorFlow Hub, PyTorch Hub, and Hugging Face. Customers can deploy these pre-trained models as-is, or first fine-tune them on a custom dataset and then deploy to a SageMaker endpoint for inference. 

This section provides example notebooks for different ML problem types supported by SageMaker built-in algorithms. Please visit `Use Built-in Algorithms with Pre-trained Models in SageMaker Python SDK <https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#id7>`_ for more documentation.

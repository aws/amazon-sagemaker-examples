    "## Managed Spot Training with a TensorFlow Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "For Managed Spot Training using a TensorFlow Estimator we need to configure two things:\n",
    "1. Enable the `use_spot_instances` constructor arg - a simple self-explanatory boolean.\n",
    "2. Set the `max_wait` constructor arg - this is an int arg representing the amount of time you are willing to wait for Spot infrastructure to become available. Some instance types are harder to get at Spot prices and you may have to wait longer. You are not charged for time spent waiting for Spot infrastructure to become available, you're only charged for actual compute time spent once Spot instances have been successfully procured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, a third requirement would also be necessary here - modifying your code to ensure a regular checkpointing cadence - however, TensorFlow Estimators already do this, so no changes are necessary here. Checkpointing is highly recommended for Manage Spot Training jobs due to the fact that Spot instances can be interrupted with short notice and using checkpoints to resume from the last interruption ensures you don't lose any progress made before the interruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to toggle the `use_spot_instances` variable to see the effect of running the same job using regular (a.k.a. \"On Demand\") infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `max_wait` can be set if and only if `use_spot_instances` is enabled and **must** be greater than or equal to `max_run`."

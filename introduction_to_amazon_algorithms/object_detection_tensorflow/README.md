### SageMaker TensorFlow Object Detection Training & Deployment
This notebook `Amazon_TensorFlow_Oject_Detection.ipynb` demos how to fine-tune and deploy a pre-trained object detection model using SageMaker API. It shows how to select a pre-trained TensorFlow object detection model and fine-tune it on an example dataset containing raw .jpg/.png images and annotations, while varying training hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch-size and number of epochs. AMT (Automatic Model Tuning) is used to search for the best hyperparameters. Once the training is complete, the notebook shows how to host the trained model for inference. It also shows how to host the pre-trained model as-it-is without first fine-tuning it.

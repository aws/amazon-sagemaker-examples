    "* Two hyperparameter tuning jobs will be created in this sample notebook. With current setting, each tuning job takes around 2 hours to complete and may cost you up to 16 USD depending on which region you are in. \n",
    "* Due to cost consideration, the goal of this example is to show you how to use the new feature, not necessarily to achieve the best result.\n",
    "* The built-in image classification algorithm on GPU instance will be used in this example.\n",
    "* Different runs of this notebook may lead to different results, due to the non-deterministic nature of Automatic Model Tuning. But it is fair to assume some training jobs will be stopped by automatic early stopping.\n",

    "Selecting the right hyperparameter values for machine learning model can be difficult. The right answer dependes on the algorithm and the data; Some algorithms have many tuneable hyperparameters; Some are very sensitive to the hyperparameter values selected; and yet most have a non-linear relationship between model fit and hyperparameter values. Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning helps by automating the hyperparameter tuning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experienced data scientist often stop a training when it is not promising based on the first few validation metrics emitted during the training. This notebook will demonstrate how to use the automatic training job early stopping of Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning to speed up the tuning process with a simple switch.\n",

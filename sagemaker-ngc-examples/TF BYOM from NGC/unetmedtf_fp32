You can also browse through other versions of this pre-trained model in the [Version history](https://ngc.nvidia.com/models/ngcmodelstage:no-team:unetmedtf_fp32/version/version) tab. \n\nTo preview the contents of the download go to [File Browser](https://ngc.nvidia.com/models/ngcmodelstage:no-team:unetmedtf_fp32/version/files) tab and select your version.\n\n### Browse to the corresponding model-script\nThis model was trained using a script also available here in the NGC and on Github. We do not recommended to use this model without its corresponding model-script which contains the definition of the model architecture, preprocessing applied to the input data, as well as accuracy and performance results. \n\nYou can access the most recent UNet_Medical model-script via [NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/model-scripts/nvidia:unet_medical_for_tensorflow) or [GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow/Segmentation/UNet_Medical). \n\nIf the pre-trainded model was trained with an older version of the script you can find the corresponding repo link in the details of the given model version in the *Version details* section below.\n\n### Build the proper NGC container and start an interactive session\nYou can support yourself with the steps described in the [Quick Start Guide](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/model-scripts/nvidia:unet_medical_for_tensorflow/quickStartGuide) of the corresponding model-script. Note that you might want to skip some steps (eg. training - as you have just downloaded an already trained model).\n\n### Run inference/evaluation\nWithin the container and with the support of the model-script, you can evaluate your model and use it for inference. Refer to sub-sections on inference in the [Quick Start Guide](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/model-scripts/nvidia:unet_medical_for_tensorflow/quickStartGuide) and [Advanced](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/model-scripts/nvidia:unet_medical_for_tensorflow/advanced) tabs.\n\n## What can you do with a pre-trained model?\nA few examples of what you can do with a pre-trained model are:\n- running inference/predictions using the model directly\n- resuming training from the downloaded checkpoint\n- building more efficient inference engines\n- transfer learning\n- training a student network\n\n## Version details\nThe following is a list of models and corresponding versions of model-scripts which were used to train them:\n\n|version|model-script|architecture config|training config|dataset|performance|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|1|[script v on NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/model-scripts/nvidia:unet_medical_for_tensorflow/files?version=) or [this github commit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree//TensorFlow/Segmentation/UNet_Medical)|default||ISBI2012||\n|1|[script v1 on NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/model-scripts/nvidia:unet_medical_for_tensorflow/files?version=1) or [this github commit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/d2bc3da0a185c2cdadb0b837456b272bcbc742dd/TensorFlow/Segmentation/UNet_Medical)|default|steps:40K, bs:2, gpus:8xV100|ISBI2012|rand_score_thin:0.94, information_score_thin:0.97|\n\n\n## Compatibility with other scripts\nAll available versions of this model were trained using corresponding model-scripts optimized for DGX usage. Although possible, usage of the model in different configurations is not supported.\n\n## Glossary\n\n\"Model-script\": a set of scripts containing the definition of the model architecture, training methods, preprocessing applied to the input data, as well as documentation covering usage and accuracy and performance results\n\n\"Model\": a shorthand for (pre)trained-model, also used interchangeably with model checkpoint and model weights.

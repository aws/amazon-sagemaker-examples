    "# Train an ML Model using Apache Spark in EMR and deploy in SageMaker\n",
    "In this notebook, we will see how you can train your Machine Learning (ML) model using Apache Spark and then take the trained model artifacts to create an endpoint in SageMaker for online inference. Apache Spark is one of the most popular big-data analytics platforms & it also comes with an ML library with a wide variety of feature transformers and algorithms that one can use to build an ML model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is designed for offline batch processing workload and is not best suited for low latency online prediction. In order to mitigate that, we will use [MLeap](https://github.com/combust/mleap) library. MLeap provides an easy-to-use Spark ML Pipeline serialization format & execution engine for low latency prediction use-cases. Once the ML model is trained using Apache Spark in EMR, we will serialize it with `MLeap` and upload to S3 as part of the Spark job so that it can be used in SageMaker in inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the model training is completed, we will use SageMaker **Inference** to perform predictions against this model. The underlying Docker image that we will use in inference is provided by [sagemaker-sparkml-serving](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-sparkml-serving-container). It is a Spring based HTTP web server written following SageMaker container specifications and its operations are powered by `MLeap` execution engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first segment of the notebook, we will work with `Sparkmagic (PySpark)` kernel while performing operations on the EMR cluster and in the second segment, we need to switch to `conda_python2` kernel to invoke SageMaker APIs using `sagemaker-python-sdk`."

    "# Debugging XGBoost training jobs in real time with Amazon SageMaker Debugger \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the MNIST dataset to demonstrate real-time analysis of XGBoost training jobs while the training jobs are running. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created and tested on an ml.m5.4xlarge notebook instance using 100GB instance volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger allows debugging machine learning training.  \n",
    "SageMaker Debugger helps you to monitor your training in near real time using rules and provides alerts if it detects issues in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using SageMaker Debugger is a two step process: Saving model parameters and analysis. \n",
    "Let's look at each one of them closely. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning process, model parameters are updated every forward and backward pass and can describe the state of the training job at any particular instant in an ML lifecycle.\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger allows you to capture the model parameters and save them for analysis.\n",
    "Although XGBoost is not a deep learning algorithm, Amazon SageMaker Debugger is highly customizable and can help you interpret results by saving insightful metrics. For example, performance metrics or the importance of features at different frequencies. \n",
    "Refer to [SageMaker Debugger documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/debugger-configuration.html) for details on how to save the metrics you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to get to model parameters and run analysis on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to use concept called ***Rules***. On a very broad level, a rule is Python code used to detect certain conditions during training.\n",
    "Some of the conditions that a data scientist training an algorithm may care about are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on.\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger comes pre-packaged with certain built-in rules that can be invoked on Amazon SageMaker. You can also write your own rules using the Amazon SageMaker Debugger APIs. \n",
    "For more details about automatic analysis using rules, see [Configure Debugger Built-in Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/use-debugger-built-in-rules.html) and [List of Debugger Built-in Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/debugger-built-in-rules.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also walk you through how to use the SMDebug client library for analysis in real time while training jobs are running. The SMDebug client library enables you to retrieve model parameters and scalars saved during training job via few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the model parameter analysis, you can drill down into training issues you're running into. You save raw model parameter data in order to understand your model better, and figure out the root cause of training problems.\n",

Amount of data saved depends on multiple factors, major ones are training job, data set, model, frequency of saving model parameters. This S3 bucket should be in your AWS account so that you have full access to control over the stored data. **Note**: The S3 bucket should be originally created in the same Region where your training job is running, otherwise you might run into problems with cross-Region access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `collection_configs`: It enumerates named collections of model parameters to save. Collections are a convenient way to organize relevant model parameters under same umbrella to make it easy to navigate them during analysis. In this particular example, you are interested in a single collection named `metrics`. You also configured Amazon SageMaker Debugger to save metrics every 10 iterations. For all parameters that are supported by Collections and DebuggerConfig, see [Collection documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/api.md)."

# DGL-LifeSci with Amazon SageMaker
[DGL-LifeSci] (https://lifesci.dgl.ai/) is a python package for applying graph neural networks to various tasks in chemistry and biology, on top of PyTorch and [DGL] (https://www.dgl.ai/). This example shows how to train models for binding affinity prediction with DGL-LifeSci on Amazon SageMaker. For more detailed information of this binding affinity prediction task, please see [the README of our original example page] (https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-lifesci/tree/master/examples/binding_affinity_prediction).

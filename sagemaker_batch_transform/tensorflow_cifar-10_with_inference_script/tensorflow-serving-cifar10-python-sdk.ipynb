    "#  Highly Performant TensorFlow Batch Inference and Training  \n",

    "For use cases involving large datasets, particularly those where the data is images, it often is necessary to perform distributed training on a cluster of multiple machines. Similarly, when it is time to set up an inference workflow, it also may be necessary to perform highly performant batch inference using a cluster.  In this notebook, we'll examine how to do these tasks with TensorFlow in Amazon SageMaker, with emphasis on batch inference. \n",

    "For training a model, we'll use a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on [the Keras examples](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/cifar10_cnn.py), but using the tf.Keras API rather than the separate reference implementation of Keras.  We'll train the CNN to classify images using the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), a well-known computer vision dataset. It consists of 60,000 32x32 images belonging to 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. Here is a graphic of the classes in the dataset, as well as 10 random images from each:\n",

    "## Distributed training with Horovod\n",
    "\n",
    "Although batch inference is the focus of this notebook, to begin we need a trained model. Sometimes it makes sense to perform training on a single machine. For large datasets, however, it may be necessary to perform distributed training on a cluster of multiple machines. In fact, it may be not only faster but cheaper to do distributed training on several machines rather than one machine. Fortunately, Amazon SageMaker makes it easy to run distributed training without having to manage cluster setup and tear down.  Distributed training can be done using methods such as parameter servers or Ring-AllReduce with Horovod, an open source distributed training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and MXNet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook we'll use Amazon SageMaker Script Mode to set up a Horovod-based training job.  In Script Mode, your training job uses Amazon SageMaker's prebuilt TensorFlow containers with TensorFlow training scripts similar to those you would use outside SageMaker.  A major advantage of Script Mode is that only a few lines of code are necessary to use Horovod for distributed training with the tf.keras API.  For details, see the `train.py` script included with this notebook; the changes primarily relate to:\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we have a training script, the next step is to set up an Amazon SageMaker TensorFlow Estimator object with the details of the training job.  It is very similar to an Estimator for training on a single machine, except we specify a `distributions` parameter describing Horovod attributes such as the number of process per host, which is set here to the number of GPUs per machine.  Beyond these few simple parameters and the few lines of code in the training script, there is nothing else you need to do to use distributed training with Horovod; Amazon SageMaker handles the heavy lifting for you and manages the underlying cluster setup."

If a use case does not require individual predictions in near real-time, an Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform job is likely a better alternative.

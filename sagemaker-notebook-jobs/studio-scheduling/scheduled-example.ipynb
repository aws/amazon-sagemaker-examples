    "### Customer Churn Use Case\n",
    "Losing customers is costly for any business. For our scheduled notebook workflow, we're going to use a familiar example of customer churn: leaving a mobile phone operator. If a provider knows that a customer is thinking of leaving, it can offer timely incentives and the customer may stick around. Incentives are often much more cost-effective than losing and reacquiring a customer.\n",
    "\n",

    "We're going to build an end to end workflow which will train a refreshed machine learning model on recent data and then generate a daily report. The process will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gather \"the last two weeks\" of carrier data. In production, this may be from a data lake or feature store.\n",
    "2. Process that data in order to train a refreshed machine learning model. \n",

    "4. Plot the Confusion matrix and F1 score of our refreshed model so that we can understand it's effectiveness on known data\n",

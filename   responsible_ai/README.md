# Amazon SageMaker Examples

### Responsible AI

Amazon SageMaker offers features to improve your machine learning (ML) models by detecting potential bias and helping to explain the predictions that your models make from your tabular, computer vision, natural processing, or time series datasets as well as providing purpose-built ML governance tools for managing control access, activity tracking, and reporting across the ML lifecycle.

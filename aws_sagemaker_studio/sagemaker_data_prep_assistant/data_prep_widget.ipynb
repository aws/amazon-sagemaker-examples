    "The [Data Wrangler data prep widget](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/interactive-data-prep-widget-for-notebooks-powered-by-amazon-sagemaker-data-wrangler/) automatically generates key visualizations on top of a Pandas data frame to understand data distribution, detect data quality issues, and surface data insights such as outliers for each feature. It helps interact with the data and discover insights that may go unnoticed with ad hoc querying. It also recommends transformations to remediate, enables you to apply data transformations on the UI and automatically generate code in the notebook cells."

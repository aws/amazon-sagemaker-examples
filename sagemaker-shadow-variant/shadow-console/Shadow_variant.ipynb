    "Amazon SageMaker now enables you to evaluate any changes to your model serving infrastructure, consisting of the ML model, the serving container, or the ML instance by shadow testing its performance against the currently deployed one. Shadow testing can help you catch potential configuration errors and performance issues before they impact end users. With SageMaker, you donâ€™t need to invest in building your own shadow testing infrastructure, allowing you to focus on model development. \n",

    "* You are considering promoting a new model that has been validated offline to production but want to evaluate operational performance metrics such as latency, error rate before making this decision\n",
    "* You are considering changes to your serving infrastructure container, such as patching vulnerabilities or upgrading to newer versions, and want to assess the impact of these changes prior to promotion\n",
    "* You are considering changing your ML instance and want to evaluate how the new instance would perform with live inference requests.\n",

    "A *production variant* consists of the ML model, Serving Container, and ML Instance. Since each variant is independent of others, you can have different models, containers, or instance types across variants. SageMaker lets you specify autoscaling policies on a per-variant basis so they can scale independently based on incoming load. SageMaker supports up to 10 production variants per endpoint. You can either configure a variant to receive a portion of the incoming traffic by setting variant weights or specify the target variant in the incoming request. The response from the production variant is forwarded back to the invoker.  \n",

A user specified portion of the requests, known as the traffic sampling percentage (VariantWeight parameter in the ShadowProductionVariants object), is forwarded to the shadow variant.

    "This example notebook shows how to create a graph neural network model to train the [Cora dataset] by using DGL with MXNet backend. It uses the Amazon SageMaker hyperparameter tuning to start multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter combinations. This helps you find the set with best model performance. This is an important step in the machine learning process as hyperparameter settings can have a large effect on model accuracy. In this example, you use the [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) to create a hyperparameter tuning job for an Amazon SageMaker estimator."

    " * You have the IAM role ARN used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for more details on creating these. If a role not associated with the current notebook instance, or more than one role, is required for training or hosting, replace sagemaker.get_execution_role() with the appropriate full IAM role ARN strings.\n"

    "# Running multi-container endpoints on Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker multi-container endpoints enable customers to deploy multiple containers to deploy different models on a SageMaker endpoint. The containers can be run in a sequence as an inference pipeline, or each container can be accessed individually by using direct invocation to improve endpoint utilization and optimize costs.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to create a multi-container endpoint which will host both the PyTorch(>=1.5) model and a Tensorflow(>=2.0) model, on a single endpoint. Here, `Direct` invocation behavior of multi-container endpoints is showcased where each model container can be invoked directly rather than being called in a sequence.\n",

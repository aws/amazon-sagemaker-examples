    "Welcome to our end-to-end example of multi-label classification using the Sagemaker 1P image classification algorithm. In this demo, we will use the Amazon sagemaker image classification algorithm in transfer learning mode to fine-tune a pre-trained model (trained on imagenet data) to learn to classify a new multi-label dataset. In particular, the pre-trained model will be fine-tuned using [MS-COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#overview) dataset. \n",

    "MS COCO is a large-scale dataset for multiple computer vision tasks, including object detection, segmentation, and captioning. In this notebook, we will use the object detection dataset to construct the multi-label dataset for classification. We will use the 2017 validation set from MS-COCO dataset to train multi-label classifier. MS-COCO dataset consist of images from 80 categories. We will choose 5 categories out of 80 and train the model to learn to classify these 5 categories. These are: \n",

    "An image can contain objects of multiple categories. We first create a dataset with these 5 categories. COCO is a very large dataset, and the purpose of this notebook is to show how multi-label classification works. So, instead we’ll take what COCO calls their validation dataset from 2017, and use this as our only data.  We then split this dataset into a train and holdout dataset for fine tuning the model and testing our final accuracy\n",

    "The image classification algorithm can take two types of input formats. The first is a [recordio format](https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.7.0/api/faq/recordio) and the other is a lst format. We will use the lst file format for training. "

    "# Amazon SageMaker Model Governance - unified model card and model registry\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks you through the features of Amazon SageMaker Model Registry. For more information, see [Model Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry-models.html) in the _Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker integrates Model Cards into Model Registry, making it easier for customers to manage governance information for specific model versions directly in Model Registry in just a few clicks. Customers register ML models in Model Registry to manage their models. Additionally, they can register ML model versions early in the development lifecycle, including essential business details and technical metadata. This integration allows customers to seamlessly review and govern models across their lifecycle from a single place. Customers have greater visibility into the model lifecycle from experimentation and training to evaluation and deployment. This streamlined experience ensures that model governance is consistent and easily accessible throughout the development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you create a binary classification model along with persisting model card information into registry to manage unified governance information and view"

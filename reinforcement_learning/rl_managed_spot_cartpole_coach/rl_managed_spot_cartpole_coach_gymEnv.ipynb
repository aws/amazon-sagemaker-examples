SageMaker Managed Spot uses [EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) to run Training at a lower cost. In this notebook, the RLEstimator function has two additional arguments `train_use_spot_instances` and `train_max_wait` to call the training \n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll start from the cart-pole balancing problem, where a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, moving along a frictionless track. Instead of applying control theory to solve the problem, this example shows how to solve the problem with reinforcement learning on Amazon SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Objective*: Prevent the pole from falling over\n",
    "2. *Environment*: The environment used in this exmaple is part of OpenAI Gym, corresponding to the version of the cart-pole problem described by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson [1]\n",
    "3. *State*: Cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole velocity at tip\t\n",
    "4. *Action*: Push cart to the left, push cart to the right\n",
    "5. *Reward*: Reward is 1 for every step taken, including the termination step\n",

SageMaker Script Mode Examples
==============================

Use your own custom training and inference scripts, similar to those you would use outside of SageMaker, to bring your own model leveraging SageMaker's prebuilt containers for various frameworks like Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and XGBoost.

Understand how you can bring your own dependencies and custom libraries to both training and inference.

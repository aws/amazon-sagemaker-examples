    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook takes you through an end-to-end workflow to demonstrate the functionality of SageMaker Ground Truth. We'll start with an unlabeled image data set, acquire bounding boxes for objects in the images using SageMaker Ground Truth, analyze the results, train an object detector, host the resulting model, and, finally, use it to make predictions. Before you begin, we highly recommend you start a Ground Truth labeling job through the AWS Console first to familiarize yourself with the workflow. The AWS Console offers less flexibility than the API, but is simple to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost and runtime\n",
    "You can run this demo in two modes:\n",
    "1. Set `RUN_FULL_AL_DEMO = True` in the next cell to label 1000 images. This should cost about $200 given the current [Ground Truth pricing scheme](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth/pricing/). In order to reduce the cost, we will use Ground Truth's auto-labeling feature. Auto-labeling uses computer vision to learn from human responses and automatically create bounding boxes for the easiest images at a cheap price. The total end-to-end runtime should be about 6h.\n",
    "1. Set `RUN_FULL_AL_DEMO = False` in the next cell to label only 100 images. This should cost \\$26. **Since Ground Truth's auto-labeling feature only kicks in for datasets of 1000 images or more, this cheaper version of the demo will not use it. Some of the analysis plots might look awkward, but you should still be able to see good results on the human-annotated 100 images.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "To run this notebook, you can simply execute each cell in order. To understand what's happening, you'll need:\n",
    "* An S3 bucket you can write to -- please provide its name in the following cell. The bucket must be in the same region as this SageMaker Notebook instance. You can also change the `EXP_NAME` to any valid S3 prefix. All the files related to this experiment will be stored in that prefix of your bucket. \n",
    "* The S3 bucket that you use for this demo must have a CORS policy attached. To learn more about this requirement, and how to attach a CORS policy to an S3 bucket, see [CORS Permission Requirement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-cors-update.html).\n",
    "* Familiarity with Python and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/).\n",
    "* Basic familiarity with [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html).\n",
    "* Basic understanding of [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).\n",
    "* Basic familiarity with [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) -- ideally, you should have it set up with credentials to access the AWS account you're running this notebook from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has only been tested on a SageMaker notebook instance. The runtimes given are approximate. We used an `ml.m4.xlarge` instance in our tests. However, you can likely run it on a local instance by first executing the cell below on SageMaker and then copying the `role` string to your local copy of the notebook."

    "We will first run a labeling job. This involves several steps: collecting the images we want annotated, creating instructions, and writing a labeling job specification. In addition, we highly recommend that you run a (free) mock job using a private workforce before you submit any job to the public workforce. This notebook will explain how to do that as an optional step. Using a public workforce, this section should take about 4 hours. However, this will vary depending on the availability of workers.\n",

Our dataset will consist of images of various species of bird.\n",

    "If you chose `RUN_FULL_AL_DEMO = False`, then we will choose a subset of 100 images from this dataset. This is a diverse dataset of interesting images, and it should be fun for the human annotators to work with. You are free to ask the annotators to annotate any images you wish as long as the images do not contain adult content. In this case, you must adjust the labeling job request this job produces; please check the Ground Truth documentation.\n",

    "We covered a lot of ground in this notebook! Let's recap what we accomplished. First we started with an unlabeled dataset (technically, the dataset was previously labeled by the authors of the dataset, but we discarded the original labels for the purposes of this demonstration). Next, we created a SageMake Ground Truth labeling job and generated new labels for all of the images in our dataset. Then we split this file into a training set and a validation set and trained a SageMaker object detection model. Next, we trained a new model using these Ground Truth results and submitted a batch job to label a held-out image from the original dataset. Finally, we created a hosted model endpoint and used it to make a live prediction for the same held-out image."

 * REDRAW_ALL -			1 means the entire widget needs to be redrawn.
 * REDRAW_PENDING -		1 means any sort of redraw is pending
 * ACTIVE -			1 means the widget is active (the mouse is in
 *				its window).
 * INVOKE_COMMAND -		1 means the scale's command needs to be
 *				invoked during the next redisplay (the value
 *				of the scale has changed since the last time
 *				the command was invoked).
 * SETTING_VAR -		1 means that the associated variable is being
 *				set by us, so there's no need for ScaleVarProc
 *				to do anything.
 * NEVER_SET -			1 means that the scale's value has never been
 *				set before (so must invoke -command and set
 *				associated variable even if the value doesn't
 *				appear to have changed).
 * GOT_FOCUS -			1 means that the focus is currently in this
 *				widget.
 * SCALE_DELETED -		1 means the scale widget is being deleted

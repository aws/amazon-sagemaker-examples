    "Welcome to our first end-to-end example! Today, we're working through a classification problem, specifically of images of handwritten digits, from zero to nine. Let's imagine that this dataset doesn't have labels, so we don't know for sure what the true answer is. In later examples, we'll show the value of \"ground truth\", as it's commonly known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, however, we need to get these digits classified without ground truth. A common method for doing this is a set of methods known as \"clustering\", and in particular, the method that we'll look at today is called k-means clustering. In this method, each point belongs to the cluster with the closest mean, and the data is partitioned into a number of clusters that is specified when framing the problem. In this case, since we know there are 10 clusters, and we have no labeled data (in the way we framed the problem), this is a good fit.\n",

    "## Labeling Adjustment Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is focusing on creation of Labeling Adjustment Jobs in SageMaker Ground Truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about the usage of label adjustment jobs as well as their creation can be found in official documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-verification-data.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customer use case description\n",
    "\n",
    "The example provided here is given for the bounding box labeling job with multiple object detection on image data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once your customer has originally labeled their dataset for object detection and trained their first models it is possible that the business requirements and priorities might change. Therefore, individual original objects which we did want to detect originally with our model might become irrelevant for further detection and should be removed, while we would want to add additional labels to be detected in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will require the original dataset to be re-labeled with the labeling adjustment job displaying the already existing labels which we want to keep while removing the labels which are not anymore in target scope. The current SageMaker Ground Truth UI enables us to remove unwanted labels from the labeling team workforce UI before launching labeling adjustment job, which will also remove the labels visually from each individual image displayed to the labeling team.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, jobs launched in this way will fail on every example image during consolidation stage where the labels have not been adjusted by the labeling team. To avoid this issue, we need to process the existing output manifest file and remove all the unwanted labels from the manifest file directly before launching labeling adjustment job.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script provided in this notebook accepts as input a set of labels to remove from the output manifest file, and the name of the labeling job containing the output manifest file to adjust. It will generate the cleaned output manifest file with only target labels removed from the latest labeling job that can be used to safely launch label adjustment job."

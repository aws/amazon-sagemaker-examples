    "Machine learning (ML) models have long been considered black boxes since predictions from these models are hard to interpret. While decision trees can be interpreted by observing the parameters learned by the models, it is generally difficult to get a clear picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model interpretation can be divided into local and global explanations. A local explanation considers a single sample and answers questions like: \"why the model predicts that customer A will stop using the product?\" or \"why the ML system refused John Doe a loan?\". Another interesting question is \"what should John Doe change in order to get the loan approved?\". On the contrary, global explanations aim at explaining the model itself and answer questions like \"which features are important for prediction?\". It is important to note that local explanations can be used to derive global explanations by averaging many samples. For further reading on interpretable ML, see the excellent book by [Christoph Molnar](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we will demonstrate the use of the popular model interpretation framework [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) for both local and global interpretation."

    "[SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) is a game theoretic framework inspired by [Shapley Values](https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P0295.html) that provides local explanations for any model. SHAP has gained popularity in recent years, probably due to its strong theoretical basis. The SHAP package contains several algorithms that, given a sample and a model, derive the SHAP value for each of the model's input features. The SHAP value of a feature represents the feature's contribution to the model's prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain models built by [Amazon SageMaker Autopilot](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/autopilot/) we use SHAP's `KernelExplainer` which is a black box explainer. `KernelExplainer` is robust and can explain any model, thus can handle Autopilot's complex feature processing. `KernelExplainer` only requires that the model will support an inference functionality which, given a sample, will return the model's prediction for that sample. The prediction being the predicted value for regression and the class probability for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that SHAP includes several other explainers such as `TreeExplainer` and `DeepExplainer` that are specific for decision forest and neural networks respectively. These are not black box explainers and require knowledge of the model structure and trained params. `TreeExplainer` and `DeepExplainer` are limited and currently can not support any feature processing."

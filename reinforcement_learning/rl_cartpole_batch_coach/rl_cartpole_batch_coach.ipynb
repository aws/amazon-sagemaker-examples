    "# Training Batch Reinforcement Learning Policies with Amazon SageMaker RL and Coach library\n",
    "\n",
    "For many real-world problems, the reinforcement learning (RL) agent needs to learn from historical data that was generated by some deployed policy. For example, we may have historical data of experts playing games, users interacting with a website or sensor data from a control system. This notebook shows an example of how to use batch RL to train a new policy from offline dataset[1]. We use gym `CartPole-v0` as a fake simulated system to generate offline dataset and the RL agents are trained using Amazon SageMaker RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to evaluate the policy learned from historical data before deployment. Since simulators may not be available in all use cases, we need to evaluate how good the learned policy by using held out historical data. This is called as off-policy evaluation or counterfactual evaluation. In this notebook, we evaluate the policy during the training using several off-policy evaluation metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can deploy the policy using SageMaker Hosting endpoint. However, some use cases may not require a persistent serving endpoint with sub-second latency. Here we demonstrate how to deploy the policy with [SageMaker Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html), where large volumes of input state features can be inferenced with high throughput.\n",

    "Batch Transform works well when there are multiple episodes interacting with the environments concurrently. One of the typical use cases is email campaign, where each email user is an independent episode interacting with the deployed policy. Batch Transform can concurrently collect rollout data from millions of user context with efficiency. The collected rollout data can then be supplied to Batch RL Training to train a better policy to serve the email users."

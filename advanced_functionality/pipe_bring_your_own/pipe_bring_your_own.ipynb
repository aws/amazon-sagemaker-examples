    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker Training supports two different mechanisms with which to transfer training data to a training algorithm: File-mode and Pipe-mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In File-mode, training data is downloaded to an encrypted EBS volume prior to commencing training. Once downloaded, the training algorithm trains by reading the downloaded training data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in Pipe-mode, the input data is transferred to the algorithm while it is training. This poses a few significant advantages over File-mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  In File-mode, training startup time is proportional to size of the input data. In Pipe-mode, the startup delay is constant, independent of the size of the input data. This translates to much faster training startup for training jobs with large GB/PB-scale training datasets.\n",
    "* You do not need to allocate (and pay for) a large disk volume to be able to download the dataset.\n",
    "* Throughput on IO-bound Pipe-mode algorithms can be multiple times faster than on equivalent File-mode algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these advantages come at a cost - a more complicated programming model than simply reading from files on a disk. This notebook aims to clarify what you need to do in order to use Pipe-mode in your custom training algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "_This notebook was created and tested on an ml.t2.medium notebook instance._\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- S3 URIs `s3_training_input` and `s3_model_output` that you want to use for training input and model data respectively.  These should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting. Since the \"algorithm\" you're building here doesn't really have any specific data-format, feel free to point `s3_training_input` to any s3 dataset you have, the bigger the dataset the better to test the raw IO throughput performance. For this example, the California Housing dataset will be copied over to your s3 bucket.\n",
    "- The `training_instance_type` to use for training. More powerful instance types have more CPU and bandwidth which would result in higher throughput.\n",
    "- The IAM role arn used to give training access to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The California Housing dataset was originally published in:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. \\\"Sparse spatial autoregressions.\\\" Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this notebook requires permissions in addition to the normal `SageMakerFullAccess` permissions. This is because you'll be creating a new repository in Amazon ECR. The easiest way to add these permissions is simply to add the managed policy `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess` to the role that you used to start your notebook instance. There's no need to restart your notebook instance when you do this, the new permissions will be available immediately."

    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this demo you're going to write an extremely simple “training” algorithm in Python. In essence it will conform to the specifications required by SageMaker Training and will read data in Pipe-mode but will do nothing with the data, simply reading it and throwing it away. You're doing it this way to be able to illustrate only exactly what's needed to support Pipe-mode without complicating the code with a real training algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pipe-mode, data is pre-fetched from S3 at high-concurrency and throughput  and streamed into Unix Named Pipes (aka FIFOs) - one FIFO per Channel per epoch. The algorithm must open the FIFO for reading and read through to <EOF> (or optionally abort mid-stream) and close its end of the file descriptor when done. It can then optionally wait for the next epoch's FIFO to get created and commence reading, iterating through epochs until it has achieved its completion criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, you'll need two supporting files:\n",
    "\n",
    "### train.py\n",
    "\n",
    "`train.py` simply iterates through 5 epochs on the `training` Channel. Each epoch involves reading the training data stream from a FIFO named `/opt/ml/input/data/training_${epoch}`. At the end of the epoch the code simply iterates to the next epoch, waits for the new epoch's FIFO to get created and continues on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the code in `train.py` is merely boilerplate code, dealing with printing log messages, trapping termination signals etc. The main code that iterates through reading each epoch's data through its corresponding FIFO is the following:"

    "* Your training dataset is not easily parse-able from a streaming source.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all other scenarios, if you have an IO-bound training algorithm, switching to Pipe-mode may give you a significant throughput-boost and will reduce the size of the disk volume required. This should result in both saving you time and reducing training costs.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to train a model using Amazon SageMaker and deploy it to Azure Functions. This approach is beneficial if you use AWS services for ML for its most comprehensive set of features, yet you need to run your model in another cloud provider in situations for example, you might have acquired a company that was already running on a different cloud provider, or you may have a workload that generates value from unique capabilities provided by AWS. Another example is independent software vendors (ISV) that make their products and services available in different cloud platforms to benefit their end customers. Or an organization may be operating in a Region where a primary cloud provider is not available, and in order to meet the data sovereignty or data residency requirements, they can use a secondary cloud provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use PyTorch with Amazon SageMaker to train a model to classify handwritten digits. Once trained, we export the model to an ONNX format and deploy it to Azure functions. To train the model, we use the popular MNIST dataset for training the model. \n",
    "MNIST is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. It contains 70000 labelled grayscale images each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into sets of 60000 training images and 10000 test images.\n",

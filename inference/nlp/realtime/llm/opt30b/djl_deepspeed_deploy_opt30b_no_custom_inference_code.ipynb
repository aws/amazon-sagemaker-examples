    "In this notebook, we explore how to host a large language model on SageMaker using the latest container launched using from DeepSpeed and DJL. DJL provides for the serving framework while DeepSpeed is the key sharding library we leverage to enable hosting of large models.We use DJLServing as the model serving solution in this example. DJLServing is a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by the Deep Java Library (DJL) that is programming language agnostic. To learn more about DJL and DJLServing, you can refer to our recent blog post (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-large-models-on-amazon-sagemaker-using-djlserving-and-deepspeed-model-parallel-inference/).\n",

    "Language models have recently exploded in both size and popularity. In 2018, BERT-large entered the scene and, with its 340M parameters and novel transformer architecture, set the standard on NLP task accuracy. Within just a few years, state-of-the-art NLP model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and similarly sized open source Bloom 176B raising the bar on NLP accuracy. This increase in the number of parameters is driven by the simple and empirically-demonstrated positive relationship between model size and accuracy: more is better. With easy access from models zoos such as Hugging Face and improved accuracy in NLP tasks such as classification and text generation, practitioners are increasingly reaching for these large models. However, deploying them can be a challenge because of their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model parallelism can help deploy large models that would normally be too large for a single GPU. With model parallelism, we partition and distribute a model across multiple GPUs. Each GPU holds a different part of the model, resolving the memory capacity issue for the largest deep learning models with billions of parameters. This notebook uses tensor parallelism techniques which allow GPUs to work simultaneously on the same layer of a model and achieve low latency inference relative to a pipeline parallel solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker has rolled out DeepSpeed container which now provides users with the ability to leverage the managed serving capabilities and help to provide the un-differentiated heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we deploy the open source OPT 30B model across GPU's on a ml.g5.24xlarge instance. DeepSpeed is used for tensor parallelism inference while DJLServing handles inference requests and the distributed workers.

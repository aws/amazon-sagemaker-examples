    "## Introduction <a id='intro'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger is the capability of Amazon SageMaker that allows debugging machine learning training. The capability helps you monitor the training jobs in near real time using rules and alert you once it has detected inconsistency in training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Amazon SageMaker Debugger is a two step process: Saving tensors and Analysis.\n",
    "Let's look at each one of them closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning algorithms, tensors define the state of the training job at any particular instant in its lifecycle.  Amazon SageMaker Debugger exposes a library which allows you to capture these tensors and save them for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although XGBoost is not a deep learning algorithm, Amazon SageMaker Debugger is highly customizable and can help provide interpretability by saving insightful metrics, such as performance metrics or feature importances, at different frequencies.\n",
    "Refer to [documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/xgboost.md) for details on how to save the metrics you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics saved can also include feature importance and SHAP values for all features in the dataset. The feature importance and SHAP values collected are what we will use to provide local and global explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After the tensors are saved, perform automatic analysis by running debugging ***Rules***.\n",
    "On a very broad level, a rule is Python code used to detect certain conditions during training.\n",
    "Some of the conditions that a data scientist training an algorithm may care about are monitoring for gradients getting too large or too small, detecting overfitting, and so on.\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Debugger comes pre-packaged with certain rules that can be invoked on Amazon SageMaker. Users can also write their own rules using the Amazon SageMaker Debugger APIs. \n",
    "For more information about automatic analysis using a rule, see the [rules documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/analysis.md).\n",

    "- ***Step*** - Object that represents next level of abstraction. In SageMaker Debugger, *step* is a representation of a single batch of a training job. Each trial has multiple steps. Each tensor is associated with multiple steps and has a particular value at each of the steps.\n",
    "- ***Tensor*** - object that represent actual *tensor* saved during training job. *Note* - it could be a scalar as well (for example, metrics are saved as scalars).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on aforementioned concepts as well as on SageMaker Debugger API in general (including examples) see [SageMaker Debugger Analysis API](https://github.com/awslabs/sagemaker-debugger/blob/master/docs/analysis.md) documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cell, use a ***Trial*** to access tensors. You can do that by inspecting currently running training job and extract necessary parameters from its debug configuration to instruct SageMaker Debugger where the data you are looking for is located. Keep in mind the following:\n",
    "- Tensors are being stored in your own S3 bucket to which you can navigate and manually inspect its content if desired.\n",
    "- You might notice a slight delay before trial object is created. This is normal as SageMaker Debugger monitors the corresponding bucket with tensors and waits until tensors appear in it. The delay is introduced by less than instantaneous upload of tensors from a training container to your S3 bucket. "

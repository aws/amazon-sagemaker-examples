    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to the Amazon SageMaker batch transform functionality.  Deploying a trained model to a hosted endpoint has been available in SageMaker since launch and is a great way to provide real-time predictions to a service like a website or mobile app.  But, if the goal is to generate predictions from a trained model on a large dataset where minimizing latency isn't a concern, then the batch transform functionality may be easier, more scalable, and more appropriate.  This can be especially useful for cases like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-off evaluations of model fit:** For example, we may want to compare accuracy of our trained model on new validation data that we collected after our initial training job. \n",
    "- **Using outputs from one model as the inputs to another:** For example, we may want use a pre-processing step like word embeddings, principal components, clustering, or TF-IDF, before training a second model to generate predictions from that information.\n",
    "- **When predictions will ultimately be served outside of Amazon SageMaker:** For example, we may have a large, but finite, set of predictions to generate which we then store in a fast-lookup datastore for serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionally, batch transform uses the same mechanics as real-time hosting to generate predictions.  It requires a web server that takes in HTTP POST requests a single observation, or mini-batch, at a time.  However, unlike real-time hosted endpoints which have persistent hardware (instances stay running until you shut them down), batch transform clusters are torn down when the job completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example we'll walk through in this notebook starts with Amazon movie review [data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html), performs on principal components on the large user-item review matrix, and then uses DBSCAN to cluster movies in the reduced dimensional space.  This allows us to split the notebook into two parts as well as showcasing how to use batch with SageMaker built-in algorithms, and the bring your own algorithm use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are only interested in understanding how SageMaker batch transform compares to hosting a real-time endpoint, you can stop running the notebook before the clustering portion of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "_This notebook was created and tested on an ml.m4.xlarge notebook instance._\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data.  This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.  We've specified the default SageMaker bucket, but you can change this.\n",
    "- The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the AWS SageMaker documentation for information on how to setup an IAM role.  Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace `sagemaker.get_execution_role()` with the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

    "Now we can begin to specify our linear model from the Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner Estimator. For this binary classification problem, we have the option of selecting between logistic regression or hinge loss (Support Vector Machines).

One piece to note is that Amazon SageMaker's Linear Learner actually fits many models in parallel, each with slightly different hyperparameters, and then returns the one with the best fit.  This functionality is automatically enabled.  There are a number of additional parameters available for the Linear Learner Estimator, so we will start be using the default features as well as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `loss` which controls how we penalize mistakes in our model estimates.  For this case, we will start with logistic and move to using hinge loss if necessary for model improvement.\n",
    "- `predictor_type` is set to 'binary_classifier' since we are trying to predict whether a failure occurs or it doesn't.\n",
    "- `mini_batch_size` is set to 99.  This value can be tuned for relatively minor improvements in fit and speed, but selecting a reasonable value relative to the dataset is appropriate in most cases.\n",
    "- `wd` or `l1` which control regularization.  Regularization can prevent model overfitting by preventing our estimates from becoming too finely tuned to the training data, which can actually hurt generalizability.  In this case, we'll leave these parameters as their default \"auto\" though."

Since model results are also affected by the data set as well, it is important to select the best hyperparmateters by searching for them using an algorithmic approach that can be automated and perform efficiently.\n",

SageMaker hyperparameter tuning will automatically launch multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter settings, evaluate results of those training jobs based on a predefined \"objective metric\", and select the hyperparameter settings for future attempts based on previous results. For each hyperparameter tuning job, we will give it a budget (max number of training jobs) and it will complete once that many training jobs have been executed.\n",

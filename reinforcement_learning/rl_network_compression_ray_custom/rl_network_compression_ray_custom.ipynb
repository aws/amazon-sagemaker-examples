    "# Distributed Neural Network Compression using Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "------------------------------------------------\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to compress a neural network (Resnet-18) using reinforcement learning. The work in this notebook is based on [1], even though heavily adapted to work with Amazon SageMaker RL. The following are the key highlights of AWS SageMaker RL demonstrated in this notebook.\n",

    "The RL problem here can be defined as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Search and find the smallest possible network architecture from a pre-trained network architecture, while producing the best accuracy possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment:** A custom developed environment that accepts a Boolean array of layers to remove from the RL agent and produces an observation that is some description of every layer in the network. This environment is sub-classed from OpenAI Gym's environment. It can be found in the [environment file](./src/environment.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "**State:** For every layer in the network there is a $1 \\times 8$ array of floats. In Resnet-18, there are 40 removable layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action:** A boolean array one for each layer. ```False``` implies don't remove the layer and ```True``` implies remove the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reward:** Consider, $C = 1 - \\frac{M_s}{M}$, where $C$ is the compression ratio, $M_s$ is the number of parameters in a network that the RL agent explores, $M$ is the number of parameters in the master network to be compressed. The reward is $r = \\frac{CA_s}{(2-C)A}$, where $A_s$ is the accuracy of the network that the RL agent explores and $A$ is the accuracy of the master network. If the explored network can't even train or is out-of-memory, the reward is $r = -1$.\n",

    "We now need an environment for our RL agent to work on. This environment has the following behavior. It accepts from our RL agent, a list of layers to remove from the master network. Once it received its list, it will create a network with the removed layers. It will then use the master network's original weights to initialize the smaller network. Once initialized, the environment will train the small network with both a cross-entropy loss and a distillation loss from the master network as described in [2]. It will then output the reward.\n",

    "The code above prints the best networks that were found during training and these are printed in the ascending order of reward. `x-factor` is how much compression has been performed and `accuracy` is the accuracy of the compressed model (trained only for 1 epoch). The `dir` is the directory where the compressed model is stored. This is in comparison with the master accuracy of `0.81`. While the best models produced here are trained, it always gives a performance boost when fine-tuned. We only train the network for a few epochs during reward calculation and hence the accuracy of the network can further be improved by fine-tuning. This can be done by using the checkpoint of the best network and fine-tuning it further for more epochs. While we only ran `1` iteration for the sake of demonstration, running more iterations will provide better results. For instance, by running for `1500` timesteps, we were able to achieve `5.7x` compression with `0.71` accuracy, which when fine-tuned further gave an accuracy of `.80`. "

# Example of Knowledge Graph Embedding Using Deep Graph Library 
This is an example of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) using Deep Graph Library (DGL). It uses the FB15K dataset, a knowledge base of general facts. An example use case would be to graph the relationships of persons and predict their nationality. 

The example notebooks demonstrate implementations of [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for the [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/) backend. They use Amazon SageMaker deep learning containers that are preconfigured with DGL, so you don't have to build the dependencies yourself. 

For more information about Deep Graph Library (DGL) please visit the DGL documentation website: https://docs.dgl.ai

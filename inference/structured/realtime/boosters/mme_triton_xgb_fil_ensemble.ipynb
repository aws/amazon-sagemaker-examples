    "With the 22.10 version release of [NVIDIA Triton](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/) container image on SageMaker you can now use Triton's Forest Inference Library (FIL) backend using SageMaker's Multi-model endpoint to easily serve multiple tree based ML models like XGBoost for high-performance CPU and GPU inference in SageMaker. Using Triton's FIL backend allows you to benefit from performance optimizations like dynamic batching and concurrent execution which help maximize the utilization of GPU and CPU, further lowering the cost of inference. The multi-framework support provided by NVIDIA Triton allows you to seamlessly deploy tree-based ML models alongside deep learning models for fast, unified inference pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints (MMEs) provide a scalable and cost-effective way to deploy a large number of deep learning models. MMEs are a popular hosting choice to host hundreds of CPU-based models among customers like Zendesk, Veeva, and AT&T. Previously, you had limited options to deploy hundreds of deep learning models that needed accelerated compute with GPUs. We announced MME support for GPU last year. Now you can deploy thousands of deep learning models behind one SageMaker endpoint. MMEs can now run multiple models on a GPU core, share GPU instances behind an endpoint across multiple models, and dynamically load and unload models based on the incoming traffic. With this, you can significantly save cost and achieve the best price performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning applications are complex and can often require data pre-processing. In this notebook, we will not only deep dive into how to deploy a tree-based ML model like XGBoost using the FIL Backend in Triton on SageMaker endpoint but also cover how to implement python-based data pre-processing inference pipeline for your model using the ensemble feature in Triton. This will allow us to send in the raw data from client side and have both data pre-processing and model inference happen in Triton SageMaker endpoint for the optimal inference performance.\n",

Otherwise, a single value will be returned indicating the class predicted for the given sample.\n",

    "* **predict_proba:** If set to true, probability values will be returned for each class rather than just a class prediction.\n",
    "* **output_class:** True for classification models, false for regression models.\n",
    "* **threshold:** A score threshold for determining classification. When output_class is set to true, this must be provided, although it will not be used if predict_proba is also set to true.\n",
    "* **storage_type:** In general, using \"AUTO\" for this setting should meet most usecases. If \"AUTO\" storage is selected, FIL will load the model using either a sparse or dense representation based on the approximate size of the model. In some cases, you may want to explicitly set this to \"SPARSE\" in order to reduce the memory footprint of large models.\n",

    "In this lab, we leveraged Triton Inference Server to create an ensemble to do Python preprocessing and used the XGBoost model to show how fraud can be detected using Triton and its corresponding Python and FIL backends. This example can further be used as a guide to create your own ensembles leveraging the other backends that Triton provides solving a wide variety of use cases that you may have that require scale and performance while using hardware for acceleration.

    "## Using SageMaker Debugger and SageMaker Experiments for iterative model pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how we can use [SageMaker Debugger](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/train-debugger.html) and [SageMaker Experiments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/experiments.html) to perform iterative model pruning. Let's start first with a quick introduction into model pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "State of the art deep learning models consist of millions of parameters and are trained on very large datasets. For transfer learning we take a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on a new and typically much smaller dataset. The new dataset may even consist of different classes, so the model is basically learning a new task. This process allows us to quickly achieve state of the art results without having to design and train our own model from scratch. However, it may happen that a much smaller and simpler model would also perform well on our dataset. With model pruning we identify the importance of weights during training and remove the weights that are contributing very little to the learning process. We can do this in an iterative way where we remove a small percentage of weights in each iteration. Removing means to eliminate the entries in the tensor so its size shrinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use SageMaker Debugger to get weights, activation outputs and gradients during training. These tensors are used to compute the importance of weights. We will use SageMaker Experiments to keep track of each pruning iteration: if we prune too much we may degrade model accuracy, so we will monitor number of parameters versus validation accuracy. \n"
